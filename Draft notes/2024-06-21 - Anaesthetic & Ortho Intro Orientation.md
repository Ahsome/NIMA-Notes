# Anaesthetic Principles
- Key components:
	- Paralysis
	- Amnesia
	- Analgesia
	- Asleep
	- Avoidence of medical comp
	- Rapid onset/offset
- Pain relief location
	- Spinal cord
		- Medication:
			- Ketamine
			- Opiods
			- a2
			- Pregabalin
		- Surgical
			- Spinal block
			- Epidural
	- Brain (Thalamus + Somatosensory Context)
		- Medication
			- Pregabaline
			- Antidepresants (TCA)
			- Opiods
			- Ketamine (disconnects thalamus and somatosensory context, it is a dissociative analgesia)
- Pre-op Assessment:
	- Normal assessment (Hx, PMHx, PSHx, SHx, FHx etc.)
	- Airway assessment
		- Are they difficult to bag maks ventilate
		- Are they difficult to ventilate using an LMA
		- Are they going to be difficult to intubate
		- Use LEMON
			- L: Look (Are they giant, beard)
			- Evaluate:
				- How much they cna open their mouth (min 3cm, mouth opening)
				- Thyromental distance (between thyroid cartilage and tip of chin)
				- Dentiation (do they have teeth, any loose teeth, if a teeth is pointing a weird way)
			- Mallampati (Score of airway)
				- 0: Can see EPIGLOTTIS, uvula and tonsils
				- 1: See whole of Uvula + tonsils
				- 2: Uvula and some of tonsols
				- 3: Some of tonsils
				- 4: Nothing
			- O: Obstruction and obesity
			- N: Neck mobility
- Predictors of difficult bag mask evntilation
	- OBESE
		- Obese
		- Beard
		- Elderly (sunken cheeks, hard to create seal)
		- Snorer (OSA) (collapsed soft tissue, so need to push it out of way)
		- Edentulous (no teeth, so nothing to press against, so we keep dentures in until we ventilate)

# Orthopaedics
Referral question:
- Get story straight
- Which bone affected
- Describe which part is injured
	- Epipjysis (intr-articular)
	- Metaphysis
	- Diaphysis (shaft)
- Describe the displacement (displaced vs undisplaced)
- Proximal or Dista
- Open vs Closed
- Pertinent PMHx
- What is your plan?
