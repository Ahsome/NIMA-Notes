Practice shortcase:
- Asthma: Exertional breathlessness, dust exposure, flower exposure (antigens), increased BMI, wheezing, and polyphonic wheezes, dry cough
- COPD: Also has dyspnea and shortness of breath, lacks the triggers of antigens, and rhonchi but does get worse with smoking. Can be IPF, but does not have triggers. Unlikely HF due to no crackles, no JVP elevation, ankle edema
- CXR, **Pulmonary function test** including Albuteral, BNP, CHEM20 changes in electrolytes, ABG to see PaCO2 and PaO2, D-Dimer
- Acute: Initial management is Salbutamol+Ipratropium, can be done outside clinic
- Long term: 
- Non-pharm: Control BMI, consider non pharm way, limit smoking, limit exposure to dust, limit exertion until controlled by treatment.
  STEP2 treatment, which is Salbutamol PRN + low-dose ICS daily. Not step 1 as has risk factrs such as smoking and high BMI

Practice shortcase:
- Diabetec Ketoacidosis, due to Type 1 diabetes (high risk factor), not taking insulin, N/V abdo pain, diarrhea, poor abdomen pain. Also low BP
- Gastroenteritis: Also causes N/V/abdo pain and diarrhea, and also potential sick contacts, but child recovered quikly. Also no sign of fever, dry mucous membranes. Appendicitis potentially, diffuse stomach pain. HHS
- FBC WCC, CHem20 Hyperkalemia low bicarb high ketones low phosphate, HHS serum osmol Blood glucose, ABG acidosis, urine disptick sign of infection, USS for appendicitis. Check HbA1c and random glucose > 11%, lipase, beta hcg, CXR. ECG for arryhtmias
- Insulin and fluid, provide pottasium so not hypo, provide glucose until ketones gone, wait till patient is not acidotic, can eat, blood glucose normal
- Cease smoking, change sights for insulin, check HbA1c. Checkup on complications, macro with stroke, autonomic with changes in bladder. Consider compibnation of insulin

Practice shortcase:
- Cellulitis. Explains redness, swollen, extended from ankle over 3 days, has fever
- Erisypelas, but does not take over 2-3 days, sharply demarcated, normally no fever. Undiagnoded DM, due to fatigue, nocturia, blurring of vision and thirst, neuropathy could mean not recognising cut which caused cellulitis. Could be heart failure with edema, but expect pitting, not fever. Could be DVT, has calf pain, tender, but pitting edema, and no fever or systemic causes. Could be PE causing swollen leg, but expect pleuritic chest pain and SOB. 
- FBC WCC, CHEM20 electrolye dysfunction, D-dimer for PE/DVT, BNP for HF. HbA1c, glucose tolerance test for diabetes. Urine dipstick for UTI
- Acute: Antibiotics for patients, continual monitoring of fever symptoms
- Long term: ELiminate risk factor with BMI, assess diabetes, call MDP.
