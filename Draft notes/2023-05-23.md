Practice shortcase:
- Asthma: Exertional breathlessness, dust exposure, flower exposure (antigens), increased BMI, wheezing, and polyphonic wheezes
- COPD: Also has dyspnea and shortness of breath, lacks the triggers of antigens but does get worse with smoking. Can be IPF. Unlikely HF due to no crackles, no JVP elevation, ankle edema
