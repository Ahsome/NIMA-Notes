Osteoarthritis: can find large bumps on side of top of finger. Herbeds nodes or something?

Seizure:
- you bite tongue laterally
- always check phenytoin levels if they take something like carbamezapine, just check if they have been taking it before recommending upping dose/add medication 

Bradycardia:
- atenolol, metoprolol cause it

Pneumonia
- SMART-COP Score for Pneumonia Severity
	- Predicts need for intensive respiratory or vasopressor support (IRVS) in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
	- If ABG or Album is not available, do a range (e.g. if score is 1 otherwise, do 1-2 if you don't know PaO2)

>[!Important]
**Tips for COVID-19:** Use to determine floor vs. ICU. Perhaps best performing to predict ICU admissions for CAP, but unclear applicability in COVID/viral pneumonias/ARDS.
