---
# Basics of Obstetrics
## Presenting patient:
1. Present patient via format:
	1. YEAR yo G_P_ Num of Week+/-Days
	2. Can use G_P_E_M_T_
	3. Add to Excel questions about asking E, M, and T for Obs Hx
	4. Make sure to get specific day
		1. Because 38weeks could be 38+0 to 38+6, or 39+0 and after
2. Importance of:
	1. Year
		1. High: Increase risk for [[Pre-eclampsia]], GDM, Stillborn
		2. Low: STI, social context, risk of pre-term birth
3. Present via SBAR
	1. S: Situation, PC and HPc
	2. B: Background, including relevant PMHx

		2. Amniotic fluid normal
		3. Fetal growth restriction?
	3. Vitals (BP, Temp, HR)
		1. If ruptured membrane, would have tachy
	4. Fetal heart rate
2. If not normal:
3. If normal:
	1. Even if normal, mother stills believes DFM
## General Pregnancy
1. SFH
	1. Limited evidence for predicitive value w/ abdominal palpation for estimating fetal weight in 3rd trim
	2. Seriel measurement of SFH and growth chart is useful screening tool

			3. Other drug, ?unsure use:, cholestyramine
			4. Others:
				1. Weekly blood test
					1. Repeat bile acid,ts LFTS
				2. Consider repeat USS
				2. Discuss induction (bile acid > 100 can induce stillbirth, so discuss need for induction)
			5. Post-term:

				2. ?Tell patient no mroe COCP due to risk, stick to progesterine-only
	3. PUPPP (Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy)
		1. Mx: Antipruritis, emollients, topical corticosteroids, oral steorids if severe

		2. Imrpove detecting and management of fetal growth restriction
		3. Raise awarenss and improve care with decreased fetal movmeent
		4. IAwareness of maternal safe going to sleep position in late pregnnacy
		5. Informed deicsion making for the timing of birth for women with risk factors for stillbirth
12. Fetal movements:
	1. Subjective perception of reduced or changed patten of fetal movmeemnts

13. Ix information:
	1. CTG
	2. USS
	3. Vitals
	4. Fetal HR
14. If rheus negative:
	1. ??625mg?? or 500IU 28 and 34 weeks
	2. And also done if sensitivising events, such as motor accident where blood can be mixed
	3. Also dose pose partum IF BABY IS Rheus Pos, if Rheus Neg then no need
	4. And ?if miscarriage, but not sure
	5. Montoring required if mother already has anti D, and if so
	6. CAN be first trimester (250IU) if
		1. Chrorionic villus sampling
		2. Miscarriage
		3. Abortion
		4. Ectopic pregnancy
		5. Molar pregnancy
15. If abdominal trauma, such as punched while pregnant
	1. Do fetal hemmorhage check? Not sure what it is called
16. Advanced materanl (AMA) age is >40
	1. Increase rayes pf
		1. Spontaneous miscarriage 1st atrim and later
		2. Ectopic preg
		3. Multiple preg
			1. Due to higher use of IVF if older, which has higher chance of multiple pregnancy
		4. Chromosomal abnomalities
		5. Reduced fertility
	2. Risk in second/third trem
		1. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
		2. GDM
		3. Placenta praevia, accreta and abruption
		4. PE
		5. Fetal growth restriction
		6. Spontaneous preterm birth
		7. Still birth

	3. Risk intrapartum
		1. Ceaesarian section (labour dystocia, fetal distess)
		2. Postpartum haemorrhage
	4. Risk post partum:
		1. Cardiovas (additional stress on aging Cardiovas system)
		2. ICU admissions
		3. Maternal death
		4. Shorter birth interval
	5. Improvement
		1. Increase maternal age associated with improved health and development in their childre, particularly cognitive ability
	6. AMA Mx
		1. LOOK FOR GUIDELIENS
		2. Preconceptual counselling: wamr of risk, optimisie medical conditons, preconceptual folic acid and iodine
		3. Avoid multiple preg if undertaking ART
		4. Aneuploidy screening: Consider NIPT as higher sensitivity and specificity
			1. There are more invasive tests for this
			2. NIPT can be done in and combined with 1st trimester screening
		5. Low dose aspirin 12-36 weeks - WHY??
			1. For higher risk of hypertension and pre-eclampsia
		6. Consider screeenign GDM in first trim
			1. Do an earlier one than the standard 26 weeks for normal adults
		7. Warn about risk of GDM, PET and have a model of care plan accordingly
		8. Consider growth ultrasounds
		9. Make a plan for stillbirth risk prevention: Discuss other stillbirth risk factors, encourage smoking cessation, discuss fetal movement patterns and side sleeping
		10. Plan for delivery: IOL at 39 weeks strongly advices. Very advanced maternal age may wish elective CS
		11. Discuss interpregnancy internval (from birth to conception) of 12-18 months due to reduction in maternal death
