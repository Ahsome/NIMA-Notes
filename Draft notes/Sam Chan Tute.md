# General advice
- Cardio, resp, nephrology, endocrinology will be the main systems
- Less likely: ID, neuro, oncology - might be some overlap
- Think about clinical investigations, important clinical signs
- This is not a hard exam to pass, but hard to get a 7
- Know INVX 
	- LFTs, hep serology
	- Spirometry, ABGx, Chest X-rays
- Not for this exam, but you need to know first and second line meds for most diseases by the time you get to intern year 
	- Less important to know treatments, but you definitely need to know follow-up - what invx to do to see if Tx is working or not 
- Polymicrobial for diabetic foot infections - broad-spectrum
- Don't need to know vasculidities 
- Do not need to know stagings of cancer 
- YOU WILL GET AN ECG in the exam
	- May not be expected to know how to read, but will need to know what to do next 
	- AFib and A. flutter are most common arrythmias 
- You don't need to know scoring, but know classifications
	- e.g. stroke LACKEYS (lacunar, etc.)
- There will be a microbiology Q in the exam - you will be able to work it out using first principles (process of elimination)
	- CAP IE
- Unlikely to be repeats 

==Sam Chan wants us to pass, know that he will make the exam passable :) ==

## GIT
- Cirrhosis, chronic disease - portal HTN, clinical signs and features e.g. spider naevi, varices, hepatorenal syndrome
- Upper and lower GI bleeding - known eitiology and what to do and how to treat a patient with bleeds 
	- Haemodynamic compromise - low BP, postural hypotension
	- PPI, packed RBCs
	- Spirinolactone is not something we would give early on
	- If stable, do an endoscopy 
- Not expected to know nutrrition and dietary history 

### Questions
1. 45yo M, h of alcoholic cirrhosis with hepatosplenomegaly. Sweaty, tachycardic, hypotension. - upper GI endoscopy
2. 2. HEP B serology - HbsAg (-)ve, HbsAb (+)ve, HbcAb (-)ve = this patient was vaccinated for HBV
3. C.diff infection post antibiotic use - commence orall metronidazole 
	1. C.diff is hard to treat, stay sick for long 
	2. In the absence if symptoms, C.diff can take up to 1month to disappear from stool culture
	3. Oral vancomycin given after investigation results, # of times they are going to toilet + signs of toxic megacolon
4. Hep encephalopathy causes - GI haemorrhage, kdiney failure, benzos, alcohol intoxication
5. Increasing dysphagia, Barrett's oseophagus - carcinoma of the oesophagus 
	1. Know dysphagia to sollids VS dysphagia to liquids and know differentials for each + know when to order a barium swallow VS ?gastric emptying study 

---

## Infectious Diseases
- Don't need to know pharmacology for every disease (e.g. meningitis), just know the basics
- UTIs are very common, leading cause of hospitalisation
	- Hard to treat, plethora of causes
	- FOCUS on this 
- ==Dysuria and pelvic pain== (UTI)
	- beta HCG
	- Do not need to image the patient!
	- Risk factors - immunocompromised, recurrent UTIs, resistant bacteria 
- Know about antimicrobial resistance e.g. beta lactamases 
	- Mechanism of resistance for flucloxacillin in an isolate of MRSA - altered penicillin binding protein 
- Don't need to know bacterial meningitis and interpret CSF

### Questions 
1. Predictor of disease progression in a patient with HIV - CD4 count
	1. Unlikely to get HIV questions in our exam
2. Rubella vaccine = live attenuated vaccine 
3. Nosocomial aquired pneumonia, most common cause = strep. pneumonia
	1. Won't get this on our exam

---

## Geriatrics
- Know the different types of incontinence - usually it is overflow, but know urge, stress, etc.
- MDT team - know everyone's roles
	- e.g. if there is a fall, who are the relevant people you would you involve? social worker 
	- e.g. swallowing issues - speech path.
- Delirium, falls
- MYOTONIC DYSPHAGIA - know
	- Myotonic dystrophy 

### Questions
1. Pre-syncope - orthostatic (know anti-HTN drugs)
2. Proximal muscle weakness/cacheia - osteoporosis is not associated with weakness
3. Comprehensive geraitric assessment - KNOW

---

## Neurology
- STROKE - know!
	- If patient has stroke, and the reg wants to put them on warfarin - why?
		- Previous stroke, valcular AF
	- Interpreting CT brains - YOU WILL BE ASKED TO INTERPRET THIS IN THE EXAM - it's rlly obvious, be smart (haemorrhagic stroke)
- Seizures, and CNS infections are not high-yield

### Questions 
1. Man with epilepsy - wide-based gait, pastpointing and intention tremor - gives phenytoin
2. Increasing fatigue over several months + sudden onset of visual loss in right eye. Temporal region tenderness  = ESR for temporal arteritis 
3. Syringomyelia - altered sensory modallity = pain and spinothalmaic tract
4. Dilation of pupil = complete third nerve palsy, atropine, toxins, neuropathy, coma caused by diabetxes/alcohol

---

## Haem/Onc
- Know anaemia + causes 
- Know about complications of malignancies
	- Cauda equina
	- ==Dexamathasone - when would you give this to a patient?== - swelling in the brain / headaches
	- Don't need to know RFs, individual treatments for cancers
	- Know complications of malignancies, when will you order an MRI, when would you give dexamethasone

### Questions 
1. Lethargy with macrocytic anaemia - B12 
2. Lethargy, fatigue and night sweats. Giant (Reed-Sternberg cells) = Hodgkins lymphoma
3. Multiple myeloma symltoms = spinal cord compresison, amyloidosis, hypercalcaemia, anaemia 

---

## Rheumatology
- Need to distinguish between RA and OA
	- RA: pain is bad after a few hours of waking up, 
- When are you going to image someone's back - at what point do you think further investigations are necessary 
	- After 6 weeks of pain
	- ==After neurological symptoms==
- Need to look at a summary of synovial fluid (joint aspirate) - is it sepsis VS gout VS pseudogout 

### Questions
1. RA high specificty tests = Anti-CCP antibody 
2. Ankylosing spondylitis - most at risk of developing basal pulmonary fibrosis 
3. SLE patient gives birth - neonatal congenital heartblock, what is most likely found in mother's serum?
	1. Anti-Rho (SSA) antibodies 

---

## Pharmacology
- Will be on the exam
- Lecture content will be in the exam
	- Chris Morris - enzyme inhibitors and enzyme inducers 
		- e.g. carbamezapine, phenytoin 
- How do you determine the loading dose of a drug? you need to know the volume of distribution pf the drug 
	- AF - load with digoxin 
- How do statins work - HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors - reduces cholesterol
- How many half-lives does a drug take to get to steady state = 3-5 

### Questions
1. Q37 - A (Drug a is 10xx more potent than drug b)
2. Q38 - which drug inhibits P450 resposible for warfarin metabolism? cimetidine 
	1. Rifampicin (anti-TB) is an inducer 
3. Q39 - after PO, drugs are most easily absorbed in the duodenum
4. Loading dose - volume of distribution
