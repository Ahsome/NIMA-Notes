# Standardised Clinical Scenario
- Scenarios published on black board, MET-style causes
- It is a "performance"
	- Don't fidget
	- Sit upright
- Onine video on blackboard on how to do SCS


# Example Case 1:
- What is likely working diagnosis
	- Hyperglycaemic episode
		- DKA
			- Possibly from fasting
			- Possibly from not taking half dose
	- Post-operative stress
	- Non-hyperglycemic stuff
		- Anaesthetic reactions
		- Aspirations after sedation
		- Gastro
		- Appendecitis
		- Perforation post-endo
	- State to keep your mind open if you feel like its non specific
	- "I'll keep my differentials wide at this stage, but my main diagnosis is Diabetic Ketoacidosis secondary to a missed insulin dose and fasting, which could result in the hyperglycemic state. Other differentials should include simple hyperglycemia, post-operative stress, and medication interaction. Other less likely non-hyperglycemic causes include gastroenteritis, appendecitis, possible perforation post-endoscopy"
- Possible exam and investigations
	- Exam
		- Start with primary differential, then what exam
		- "My primary differential is DKA, as such my targeted exam include..."
		- General inspection + Vitals
			- Look for signs of acidosis (respiratory distress)
		- Hydration status
		- Signs of sympathetic activation: Diapheretic etc.
		- GI exam
			- Injection site for diabetes
		- Cardiac
		- Resp
		- Feet
			- Diabetes exam
	- Investigations
		- Bedisde
			- Urine dipstick: Ketones and Leukocytes (infection)
			- Another BGL
			- bHCG
		- Blood
			- FBC
			- CHEM20
				- Serum electrolytes (specifically for K+)
			- Kidney function (possibly cause of hypovolemia)
			- VBG (acid base status + lactate)
		- Imaging
			- Erect CXR
		- "If exam shows more, I would consider advanced imaging"
		- Make sure when you state investigations, dont just say why but what you're looking for in particular. In this case, serum electrolytes to see if low due to DKA
- Provided exam and investigations
	- Give summary of results after stating each line
	- Exam
	- Investigations
