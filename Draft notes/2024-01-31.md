# Diabetic Note Taking
Remember complications:
1. Microvascular
2. Macrovascular
3. Autonomic
4. Hypo events & patient understanding of hypo
# Approach to Long Case
## Overall
1. 60 minutes with patient, 10 minutes of writing time, 25 minutes with 2 examiners
2. Complete 15 - 20 cases, around 2x a week
3. Practice:
	1. Every admission/OPD review is a chance to practice
	2. Guidelines are very useful. i.e. KDIGO, HF, COPD, ETG
	3. Supplemented with traditional sources
	4. Talley: Examination Medicine for Longs and Shorts is aimed at physician trainees and is more advanced than our expectations
4. Components:
	1. Opening Statement (this contextualizes the case and positions your audience)
	2. HPC
	3. PMHx and PSHx
	4. Medications (incorporated into body of medical history above)
	5. FHx (variable relevance)
	6. Mood screening (in particular for depression)
		1. How you been feeling?
		2. How is sleep, how is apetite
	7. SHx
	8. O/E
	9. Summary
	10. Issue List
## Opening statement
1. Include:
	1. Sex, age, social statement, presentation, background, implciations
	2. e.g. Mr. S is a 58yo accoutant who presents with the acute management issue of refractory heart failure on a background of ischaemic cardiomyopathy,  end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis, metabolic syndrome and depression. his increasing rate of hospital admission threatens his ability to maintain independence in the community
	3. **NOTE: Tutor belives keeps implications to [[#Summary]]**
## HPC
1. Consider initially asking **all the** current diagnosis they have, as a list, no details so you know what they could have
2. Ask "Why did you come to the hospital"
3. Use PRIC-MCP mneumonic
	1. P: Presentation
		1. When did it first present
	2. R: Risk factors
		1. e.g. Infection: Sick contacts
	3. I: Investigations
		1. Help include/exclude differentials
		2. Severity/Complications
	4. C: Current function
		1. e.g. If currently with arthritis, what exercise you can do
		2. e.g. If heart failure, what is their NYHA class, what is their exercise tolerance
	5. M: Management:
		1. Any recent changes
		2. Any medications
		3. What has been done in hospital
	6. C: Complications:
	7. P: Prognosis, Insight, progress, **FOLLOW UP**
4. Ask about progress since admission including investigations, treatments, and clinical response as they may have additional useful information for you
5. Do a systems review, and try memorise the sys review
## PMHX
1. For each PMHx
	1. Date of diagnosis, how it was reached
		1. e.g. T2DM diagnosied Aug 2023, Hba1c 10%
	2. Management
	3. Complications of disease
	4. Complications of treatment
	5. Follow up/prognosis
## PSHx
1. Keep it basic with name and date of procedure, unless jey to relevant issue
## Meds and Allergies
1. Should list each current meds
2. Best option: Present meds as you go; it makes more clinical sense to lsit them in relation to relevant PMHx
3. Can present as a list if you are not sure
4. Allergies/ADR's and nature of reaction (be brief)
## FHx
1. Vairable relevant depending on case, but at basic level as about first degrree (Mom, Dad, Siblings)
2. Very relevant if strong genetic component
## Mood Screening
1. Simple screening questions i.e. ddescription of mood, anhedonia, considration of psychological stresses and protective factors (SADFACES)
## Social History:
1. This is **THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT**
2. Compoments:
	1. Employment (past/current) or study status
	2. Living Sitatuon: Where, with whom, accessibility
	3. Financial stability and support
	4. Mpbiloity including any required aids, driving
	5. ADL's splitting into personal (e.g. showering) and instrumental (buying groceries), nothing any assistance services
	6. Advanced care planning; will, EPOA, AHD, ARP
	7. Substance use; alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs
	8. Engagement with health in the community; GP relationship, if there is any
	9. Preventive medicine
		1. Vaccinations (for extra bonus, consider risk groups and implications; asplenic, indigenous, immune suppressed)
		2. Age appropriate cancer screening (e.g. bowerl stool)
# Physical Examination:
1. Do the following:
	1. General inspection: Well, unwell, colour, respiratoyr effort, GCS, snesorium
	2. Cardio: Hands, volume, status, auscultation
	3. Respiratory: WOB, hands, auscultation
	4. Abdominal: Palpation, organomegaly, signs of CLD
2. If indicated:
	1. Nueurology: Full or targeted dpeending on case i.e. PN in T2DM
	2. Haem: Spleen and additional LN groups
	3. Endocrine: Diabetic foot most common, thyroid and acromegaly very rare
## Summary
1. Include
	1. Generally restate elements of [[#Opening statement]] with greater emphasis on clinical case context and major problems with a call to action
	2. e.g. Mr. S is a 58yo M who presents with the acute management of issue refractory decompensated heart failure likely secondary to non-compliance with medical therapy in the context of his escalating depression. His apathy and disregard for his health places hima t great risk of permanent harm
## Issues
1. Reflect order of importance
2. Focus on 5 major issues, split cross acute, chronic, and social history
3. Always ask what is the patient's most major issue (i.e. if i had a magic wand, what would you like to fix)
4. If patient has something they do not know, such as why they have a medication, or why they are doing certain treatment, or something about their past medical history, that can be an issue for the issue list
5. First issue: Generally witll be presenting problem i.e. Dx and Mx issue of chest pain OR the patient's perceived number 1 issue
6. Usually an expectation of at least 1 social issue
	1. Substance dependence
	2. Social isolation
	3. Safety of dischanrge destination
	4. Insight into medicla conditions
	5. ACP
