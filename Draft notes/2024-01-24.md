# Syncope
**Definition:** Transient LOC due to cerebal hypoperfusion
- Other causes:
	- If abnormal excessive brain activity seizure
	- If psychological process of conversion, psychogenic transient LOC
	- If ehad trauma, traumatic LOC
- Rapid onset
- Short duration
- Spontaneous complete recovery
- Transient LOC requires:
	- Loss of awareness and responsiveness
	- Amnesia for period of onconsciousness
	- Abnormal motor control
		- Myoclonic jerks
	- Short duration
**Mimics:**
- Seizures - prodrome, unusual posturing, cut tongue, postictal confusion, head turning to one side
- Concussions
- Hypoglycemia
- Intoxication - consciousness may be impared. but not lost; duration long
- Cataplexy - falls with flaccid paralyis and unresponsiveness, no amnesia
- SAH
- Vertebrobasilar TIA - focul neuro signs adnd symptoms, usually without LOC
	- Difference between TIA and [[Stroke]]: TIA has complete resolving and returning of function
- ?Hypotension
- **Was it heralded or unheralded?**
	- àe.g. autonomic activation prior (e.g. pallor, sweating) may suggest reflex syncope
	- Truly unheralded syncope is more suggestive of cardiac syncope (e.g. VT)

## Risk factors:
1. Medications causing low BP
2. Alcohol use
3. VOlume depletion (hamorrhage, low fluid intake, diarrhoea, vomiting)
4. Pulmonary disease
5. Stress

## Diagnositc Approach:
If clinical presentation is consistent with syncope, initial assessment should include:

Postural BP:
- Wait for 2 minutes between sitting and standing
- Don’t rely on automated BP or nurses BP (also usually automated); do it yourself!
- Systolic BP drop ≥20mmHg (or <90mmHg standing); diastolic BP drop ≥10 mmHg
- Check pulse concurrently: OH-mediated syncope (e.g. 2’ to anaemia or volume depletion etc) usually cause postural drop with postural tachycardia, while in reflex syncope, there is a drop in sympathetic tone, and vagal stimulation leads to bradycardia

ECG: look at PR, QRS and QTc intervals; are there conduction defects? are there ischaemic changes?

U+E, Hb: consider renal/electrolyte derangement and anaemia

Don’t forget PE (impaired venous return / cardiac output) as cause for unexplained syncope

*Other investigations:*
**Arrhythmia**

-High risk (e.g. supine or exertional syncope; FHx of SCD, NSVT, conduction abnormalities on ECG): Inpatient telemetry
-Lower risk: Holter monitoring, external loop recorder; implantable loop recorder (e.g. if recurrent syncope and cause not already identified)

**Structural cardiac syncope:**
- Transthoracic echo
- Ischaemic evaluation e.g. angiography
- Cardiac MRI

Other investigations: exercise stress testing, tilt table, carotid sinus massage, EP studies
## Vasovagal Syncope:
- Often have tunnel vision

## Cardiac syncope:
- Get ECG, useful for identifying if cardiac syncope
- Need a few tests to rule out ECG
	- ECG
	- Others (not discussed)

## Treatment
Reflex syncope & Orthostatic hypotension

-Usually benign prognosis, but unpredictable and may be disabling

-Education, reassurance, avoid known triggers

-Limit known risks e.g. replace volume deficits; behavioural changes (slow-to-rise); revise anti-hypertensives

-Some evidence for salt supplementation for recurrent reflex syncope (if no contraindications)

-Consideration of pharmacotherapy e.g. fludrocortisone, midodrine (if no contraindications)

Cardiac syncope (specific to underlying cause)

-Arrhythmia: bradycardia à pacing

-Structural: aortic stenosis e.g. aortic valve replacement

-If high-risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD): consideration of ICD insertion

## Post-Treatment
If & when can patient be cleared to drive?
- Refer to fitness to drive guidelines
- If 1x unexplained blackout à 6 month driving exclusion!
	- Vasovagal syncope with clear-cut precipitating factor and unlikely to occur while driving à can resume driving within 24 hours
	- Cardiac syncope à an appropriate non-driving period is required (at least four weeks for private vehicle drivers and at least three months for commercial vehicle drivers), after which time their ongoing fitness to drive should be assessed.

# Cardiac
## Hypertension
1. When giving medications, try to give maximum tolerated dose of ACE inhibitor (e.g ramipril) before introduction of a CCB (e.g. lercanidipine).
	1. This is especially because while CCB is a antihypertensive, it does not do any cardiac remodelling, so it is recommended to give an ACE to maximum tolerated amount

## Mitral Stenosis:
1. Apex beat:
	1. Causes a "tapping" apex beat, very associated with MS

## Hear Failure:
1. Four main components of Heart Failure management in HpRef
	1. Betablocker (long acting)
	2. ACE/ARB
	3. Spironolactone
	4. SGLT2
