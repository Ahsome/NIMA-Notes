# Syncope
**Definition:** Transient LOC due to cerebal hypoperfusion
- Other causes:
	- If abnormal excessive brain activity seizure
	- If psychological process of conversion, psychogenic transient LOC
	- If ehad trauma, traumatic LOC
- Rapid onset
- Short duration
- Spontaneous complete recovery
- Transient LOC requires:
	- Loss of awareness and responsiveness
	- Amnesia for period of onconsciousness
	- Abnormal motor control
		- Myoclonic jerks
	- Short duration
**Mimics:**
- Seizures - prodrome, unusual posturing, cut tongue, postictal confusion, head turning to one side
- Concussions
- Hypoglycemia
- Intoxication - consciousness may be impared. but not lost; duration long
- Cataplexy - falls with flaccid paralyis and unresponsiveness, no amnesia
- SAH
- Vertebrobasilar TIA - focul neuro signs adnd symptoms, usually without LOC
	- Difference between TIA and [[Stroke]]: TIA has complete resolving and returning of function
- ?Hypotension

## Risk factors:
1. Medications causing low BP
2. Alcohol use
3. VOlume depletion (hamorrhage, low fluid intake, diarrhoea, vomiting)
4. Pulmonary disease
5. Stress


## Vasovagal Syncope:
- Often have tunnel vision

## Cardiac syncope:
- Get ECG, useful for identifying if cardiac syncope
- Need a few tests to rule out ECG
	- ECG
	- Others (not discussed)

# Cardiac
## Hypertension
1. When giving medications, try to give maximum tolerated dose of ACE inhibitor (e.g ramipril) before introduction of a CCB (e.g. lercanidipine).
	1. This is especially because while CCB is a antihypertensive, it does not do any cardiac remodelling, so it is recommended to give an ACE to maximum tolerated amount

## Mitral Stenosis:
1. Apex beat:
	1. Causes a "tapping" apex beat, very associated with MS
