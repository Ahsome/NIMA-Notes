# TOdo
1. Learn risk factors for VTE, its on the slides
# Lower Limb Redness:
1. If continual lower limb oedema (chronic), increase rate of infection and cellulitis due to thinning of skin
2. Chronic venous insufficiency is similar to cellulitis, but no warmth to touch
	1. More likely to be bilateral than [[Cellulitis and Erysipelas]] which is unilateral
3. Warfarin can mimic neck fasch due to brief pro-coag effect on Protein C
4. [[Lymphodema]]: Look for upside down champagne bottle shape
5. [[Hyperthyroidism]] can cause pretibial myxedma from Graves Disease
6. [[Diabetes Mellitus]] patients are prone to foot ulcers and infections
8. V/Q mismatch over CTPA if:
	1. Kidney function is impaired
	2. Pregnancy
	3. Otherwise use CTPA
9. If you think cellulitis, think of specific exposure (see powerpoint)
		1. etc. salt water, has vibrio vulnificus, rapid change. Add doxycycline for coverage of Vibio if salt exposure
	1. Fresh water: Aeromonas hydrophilia
	2. HIV/immunocompromised: Cryptococcus neofomans, strep iniae, myocabterium abscessus
	3. CLD: Gram negatibe bacteria
	4. Crepitant/gangrenous cellulitis: Clostiridum spp.
	5. Toe-web intertrigo and diabetic feet: pseudomonas (think Piptaz)
	6. Fisherman, shellfish handler: Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae

Neck fasch:
1. Pain out of proportion
2. Crepitus on examination
## Cellulitis
### Ix:
1. Blood culture (if febrile or systemic sings)
2. BGL, ketone and HbA1C.
3. USS for DVT/subcut abscess
4. FBC
5. CHEM20
6. Swab
	1. Only helpful for MRSA as otherwise will culture everything
	2. Instead do deep skin cleaning and testing w/ podiatry 
7. CXR (septic screen)
8. Urine (septic screen)
9. CRP

Management:
1. Fluclox, 2g every 6 hours
	1. Unsure, confirm later
2. Fluids (maintenance, 125ml/hr?)
3. Pain management
4.
