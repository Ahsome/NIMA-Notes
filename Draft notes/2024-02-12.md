1. Learn risk factors for VTE, its on the slides
# Lower Limb Redness:
1. If continual lower limb oedema (chronic), increase rate of infection and cellulitis due to thinning of skin
2. Chronic venous insufficiency is similar to cellulitis, but no warmth to touch
	1. More likely to be bilateral than [[Cellulitis and Erysipelas]] which is unilateral
3. Warfarin can mimic neck fasch due to brief pro-coag effect on Protein C
4. [[Lymphodema]]: Look for upside down champagne bottle shape
5. [[Hyperthyroidism]] can cause pretibial myxedma from Graves Disease
6. [[Diabetes Mellitus]] patients are prone to foot ulcers and infections
7. V/Q mismatch over CTPA if:
	1. Kidney function is impaired
	2. Pregnancy
	3. Otherwise use CTPA

Neck fasch:
1. Pain out of proportion
