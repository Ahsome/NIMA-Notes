# Antenetal History
- Blood group
- NIPT
- Any antenetal bloods
- Morph USS (if twins, placentas, number of normal morph)
- Serial growth scans
- K36 bloods
	- Hb
	- Ferritin
	- Folate
	- OGTT

# Twins
- Often iron deficient due to two or more babies sucking iron
	- Always consider iron deficiency

## Broken Water
PPROM <37 weeks
PROM (prolonged) >18hrs

PPROM RF:
MOST HAVE NO IDENTIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
- Preivous PPROM (13% vs 2-4%)
- Genital tract infection (esp bacteriol vaginosis)
- APH if occurs after 1st trim, increase risk 3-7x
- Smokers
- Polyhydraminos
- Acute trauma
### Examination:
- Vital
- Abdo tenderness
- CTG
- USS
- Speculum
	- DO - High/low vaginal swab

### Investigations:
- FBC/CHEM20
- Group and Hold
- CRP
	- Rule out signs of infection
	- Cause of PPROM
- USS
- Urine M/C/S
- LVS/HVS

### Management:
- Based on gestational age, individual maternal and fetal circumstances
- Admission (length dependent on gestation)
- Paeds review if preterm
- MgSO4 (<K30) if TPTL - minimum of 4 hours
- Steroids (<K34+6)
	- Bethamethasone 11.4mg IM 24 hours apart
	- Reduces risk of
		- Neonatal death
		- Respiratory distres ssyndrome (RDS)
		- Intraventricular haemorrhage
		- Necrotising enterocolitis
	- Can consider rescue dose steroids, controversial
- Antibiotics (IV or oral) (double check actual dosages with guidelines)
	- Ampiciliin via drip + oral arithromycin first 48 hours
	- Oral amoxicillin later
	- No clavulonate acid as can cause necrotising enterocolitis
	- GBS
		- No universal screening in Queensland
		- If any positive swab, either for GBS swap or GBS UTI during pregnancy, treat even if swab is negative closer to delivery
- At term expectant management vs induction/LSCS
- Initial monitoring: 4 hourly OBS
	- Maternal HR, Temp
	- Vaginal loss
	- Uterine tenderness/activity
	- As about fetal movements, FHR
	- If greater than 28-30 weeks gestation, daily CTG


## Routine AN care for twins
Supplement requirement
- Consider Iron, folic acid, calcium, iodine, vit D, aspirin
Early diabetes screening
	?OGTT 16 weeks, and 26-28 weeks.
Dietary advice re: dieal weight gain
Monitoring for PET risk:
- Baseline blood pressure test
Diagnosie type of twins by US K11+0 -K13+6 (CRL45-85mm), including fetal viability, gestationalage, and exclude congenital malformation
### High risk AN care
- Early antenatla appointmnet
- Increased frequency of AN appoinments
- Invovle MDP (obstetrics, MFM/Ultrasonographer, MW, Anaesthetics, Dietician, Perinantal MH, SW, Physiotherapist, Lactation Consultant)
- Refer to tertiary centre for MCMA, triplets and complications

## Management of twins
- TIming and mode of birth
	- DCDA: CS or vaginal birth from K37
	- MCDA: CS or vaginal birth (?controversial) from K36
	- Triplets: CS from K35, w/ steroids prir
	- MCMA: CS from K33, w/ steroids prior
- Vaginal birth of twins:
	- USS confirm presenting twin cephalic
	- IVC, FBC, G+H
	- Appropriate location + team (Obs/Paeds/OT)
	- If IOL, consider balloon catheter
	- Continuous fetal monitoring in labour: Ideally FSE T1+external monitor T2
	- Epidural reomended in case manipulation of second twin required
	- Routine care for progress - document on partogam
	- Notification of Obs + Paeds team at full dilation w/ birth imminent; notify anaesthetics/OT
	- .....
	- Collect gasses to confirm normal at delivery
	- No maxium interval dictated between T1 and T2 if fetal heart remains reassuring, FIGO good practice recommends <30mins
	- Recomend active third stage managmenet
		- Syntometrine unless contraindication (then Syncotrin)

### Complications
- Cord prolapse (especially if breach/transverse)
- Intrauterine infection
- Antepaetum hamorrhage (placenta abruption)
- Pre-term beirth
- Growth restriction

MCDA-speicific twins:
- Twin to twin transfusion syndrome
	- Potentially one twin donating blood to another
	- Other twin would get polyhydraminos, and polycythemia, and heart failure (from pumping increased blood)
- Twin anaemia polycthemia sequence (TAPS)
- Selective fetal growth restriction of one twin
- Twin revered arterial perfusion sequence (TRAP)
- Single fetal demise
- Congenital anomalies


## Management of twin-twin syndrome
- Fetoscopic laser ablation of placental vascular
	- Recommended managemnt in TTTS requiring intervention
- Aminoreduction
	- Reduce amniotic fluid
	- Less effective than fetoscopic laser ablation
- Selective fetal reduction
	- Occluding cord to single twin, only considered if one twin is considered to die anywhere
