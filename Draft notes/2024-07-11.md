# Med notes
- [ ] Added to notes
- [ ] Added to excel
- [ ] Add to document: Mx for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, not just for DKA/HHS but overall to identify the cause
- [ ] Look over QLD Health DKA protocol on QWEPS (Title is Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults age 16 or over): https://clinicalexcellence.qld.gov.au/resources/diabetes-resources/diabetic-ketoacidosis
- [ ] Use the ClinicalExcellence pathway for everything

# Endocrinology Tutorial
Variably glycemic control:
- Causes
	- Hyperglycemic
		- Infection
		- Parenteral nutrition
		- Physiological stress
		- Drugs (glucocorticoids, antipsychotics)
		- Witholding diabetic medication
	- Hypoglycemic
		- Reduced oral intake
		- Impaired renal function
		- Overzealous prescribing diabetic medications

Mx for hyperglycemia:
- Ix (Look for causes):
	- Ketones
	- VBG
		- Bicarb, if acidotic
	- Septic screen
	- Conside
		- ECG (if indicated)
		- hCG (females, if indicated)
- Treatment (DKA)
	- DRS ABCD
		- Involve reg and consultant early
	- Get IV access
	- Follow DKA protocol (print 2 copies, one with nurse and one with you)
		- Fluids (due to intravascular dry).
			- 1L STAT, 1L over 30min, 1L over 1hr, 1L over 2h
			- Useful in young age, if older shift
			- Normal saline currently, can be hartmans
		- Insulin
			- Check potassium as it can cause potassium into cell, can cause arrythmia
			- IV infusion
			- If they are on regular insulin, keep giving it ON TOP of infusion
		- Dextrose
			- Provide as blood glucose improves, like around <14
			- Aim glucose 9-14 mmol/L until ketones cleared
		- Pottasium
		- Consider VTE prophylaxis, esp if dry and immobolised
	- Complication management
	- Consider ICU if red flags
		- Altered level of consciousness
		- Severe hypokalemia
		- Severe hyponatremia
		- Pregnancy
	- Medium-term mamangement
		- Transition to subcut if:
			- They are well and eating/drinking
			- Anion gap is normal
			- Ketones are <0.6 mmol/L
			- Long acting insulin has been give/reconnected for at least 2 hours
