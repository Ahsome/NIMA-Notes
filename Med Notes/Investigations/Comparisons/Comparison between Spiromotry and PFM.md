## Table:
| Spiromotry                                              | Peak Flow Meter                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Greater accuracy than PFM                               | Portable device                         |
| Can identify baseline characterisitcs ("personal best") | Allows rapid serial measurement of PEFR |
| Difficult to perform compared to PFM                    | Less accurate than spirometry                                        |
| Greater logistical challenge                            |                                         |
