# Information
Hypertension is increase blood pressure in a patient, and it is dependent on age, cormobidities, past medical history, genetics, lifestyle factors etc.

### Hypertensive Urgency
**Hypertensive urgency** is severe hypertension without end-organ damage
There is no agreed upon BP value, ususually >180/120. See [[#^f27c31|Complications with Hypertensive Emergency]]

### Hypertensive Emergency
**Hypertensive emergency** is severe hypertension with end-organ damage. The most common cause is due to longstanding HTN who stops meds

### Malignant Hypertension:
**Malignant hypertension** is a [[#Hypertensive Emergency]] that occurs with papilledema.

> [!Important] 
- Diagnosis of hypertension *requires* **more than one** measurement ^4dbc79
- Screen every patient with new onset hypertension. See [[Hypertension#Inital screening:]]
- Initial treatment should always be **lifestyle** factors. Only choose pharmacology after an attempt. See [[Hypertension#Initial management:]]

---

## Aetiology:
### Primary:
Primary (essential) is **the most common cause**, with no clear cause

### Secondary:
Secondary has some known cause:
- This is most commonly [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]
- Others include:
	- Hyperaldosteronism
	- Renal artery stenosis
	- Pheochromocytoma

### White coat hypertension
Hypertension only in the clinic, likely due to stress of being in a hospital setting

---

## Risk factors:
Risk factors include:
- Family history
- African-American race
- High salt intake
- Alcohol
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity

---

## Investigations:
### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis of hypertension _requires_ **more than one** measurement
| Stage           | SBP     | or | DBP   |
| --------------- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| Normal          | <120    | and | <80   |
| Prehypertension | 120-129 | and | <80   |
| Stage I         | 130-139 | or  | 80-89 |
| Stage II        | \> 140    | or  | \> 90   |
| Hypertensive    | \> 180    | or  | \> 120      |

If the blood pressure is >180/120, this can be either a [[#Hypertensive Emergency]]
 or [[#Hypertensive Urgency]].
 
### Comorbidities:
| Test             | Disease                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| HbA1c            | [[Diabetes Mellitus]]                    |
| Fasting glucose  | ^^                                       |
| Lipid Panel      | Hyperlipidemia                           |
| ECG              | [[Myocardial Infarction]], check Q-waves |
| Serum creatinine | [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]               |
| Urine dipstick   | Proteinuria                                         |

## Management:
### Initial screening:
There should be an initial screening for any [[Hypertension#Complications|Complications and comorbid conditions]]. See [[Hypertension#Complications|Investigations > Complications]]

### Initial management:
Initial management should always be **lifestyle modification**, focused on **weight loss**. This is the most effective intervention. Pharmacological comes when lifestyle is restricted, or there are [[Hypertension#^39a12c|compelling indications]]

The second most effective intervention is the **DASH diet**. See [[Hypertension#DASH diet:|DASH diet table]]:
- Vegetables, fruits
- Whole grains
- Poultry, fish
- Low in sugar and red meats

Others include:
1. Exercise
2. Sodium restriction
3. Alcohol limitation

#### Pharmacological management:
Initial choices include:
1. [[Thiazide]] diuretics
2. [[ACEi]], [[ARB]]
3. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers

Compelling indications: ^39a12c
| Indication                      | Drug                   | Reasoning                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Prior [[Myocardial Infarction]] | [[Beta-blocker]]       | Helps with heart function     |
| [[Diabetes Mellitus]]           | [[ACEi]] or [[ARB]]    | Renal protective              |
| [[Osteoporosis]]                | [[Thiazide]] diuretics | Helps maintain calcium levels |
| Proteinuria                     | [[ACEi]] or [[ARB]]    | Renal protective                              |

### Hypertensive Emergency:
Treatment should involve **gradual reduction in blood pressure** to <160/100:
- MAP reduced no more than 25% to 30% in first 2hr
- Otherwise, a rapid reduction will cause ischemia

Drug choices include (all IV):
- Hydralazine
- Esmelol
- Nitroprusside
- Labetalol
- Clevidipine or Nicardipine

--- 

## Complications:
Issues that can occur due to HTN:
- Stroke
- Heart disease
	- MI
	- Heart failure
- [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]
- Aortic aneurysm
- Aortic dissection

Issues that occur due to [[#Hypertensive Emergency]]: ^f27c31
- Neurological impairment
	- Retinal hemorrhages
	- Encephalopathy
- Renal impairment
	- Acute renal failure
	- Hematuria, prteinuria
- Cardiac ischemia
