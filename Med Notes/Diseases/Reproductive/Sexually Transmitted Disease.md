# Information
Sexually Transmitted Disease is infections spread by specific diseases. These include:
1. Chlamydia

### Chlamydia:
1. Special cell walls, lack peptidoglycan
	1. Do not respond to antibiotics.
	2. Treatment is azithromycin and doxycycline
2. 3 forms
	1. C. trachomatis
		1. Most common STI form
		2. Conjuctivitis and pneumonia in babies. Spread through birth canal
		3. Causes [[Lymphogranuloma venereum]] and [[Trachoma]]
			1. ![[Pasted image 20230513215402.png]]
	2. C pneumonia
		1. Atypical pneumonia by aerosol
	3. C psittaci
		1. Parrot fever, infection from birds

#### Lymphogranuloma Venereum:
1. Sexually transmitted chlamydia infection, spreads through lymphacs
2. Serotype L1, L2, L3
3. Initially painless genital ulcer, becomes tender inguinal or femoral lymph nodes
	1. Called "Buboes"

### N. Gonorrhoea:
1. Stain: Gram neg diplococci
2. Second most common STI
3. Causes urethritis and cervicitis
4. Causes proctitis and **pharyngitis**
5. Can disseminate, cause **arthritis**
	1. Non STI form: N. Meningitidis, causes meningitis

	3. Can progress to PID
2. Men: Urethritis, epididymitis, Prostatitis
	1. May lead to discharge from penis or dysuria
	2. Proctitis
3. Lymphogranuloma:
	1. Initially, painless genital ulcer
	2. Later, painful inguinal or femoral lymph nodes: Burboes

N. Gonorrhoea:
1. Men:
	1. Urethritis and epididymitis
	2. Dysuria, discharg
2. Women:
	1. Cervicitis
	2. Itching, discharge
	3. Not painful
3. Proctitis
4. Pharyngitis
5. Arthritis

# Management
## Treatment

### Chlamydia management:
1. Special cell walls, lack peptidoglycan
	1. Do not respond to antibiotics.
	2. Treatment is azithromycin and doxycycline
		1. Pregnancy: Azithromycin, as doxy is bad for pregnancy
2. Test of N. Gonorrhoeae as often co-infected
3. Must treat partners or reinfection occurs

**Lymphogranuloma Venereum** management:
1. Drain buboes
2. Treat with antibiotics
	1. Doxycycline
	2. Azithromycin

### Gonorrhea management:
1. Ceftriaxone:
	1. Lowest frequency of treatment failure
	2. Given as single IM dose
2. Co-infection of [[#Chlamydia:]] is common
	1.
