# Information
Sexually Transmitted Disease is infections spread by specific diseases. These include:
1. Chlamydia

### Chlamydia:

	1. Do not respond to antibiotics.
	2. Treatment is azithromycin and doxycycline
2. 3 forms
	1. C. trachomatis
		1. Most common STI form
		2. Conjuctivitis and pneumonia in babies. Spread through birth canal

### Genital herpes:
1. Sexually transmitted infection due to herpes simplex virus.
2. Normally HSV-2, sometimes HSV-1
3. Primary infection:
	1. Sometimes asymptomatic
	2. May lead to painful vesicles on erythematous base
	3. Can cause fever and lymphadenopathy
	4. Antibody testing is negative
4. Latent phase:
	1. Virus enters in lumbar sacra nerves
5. Recurrent eruptions:
	1. Vesicles and ulcers
	2. Less severe than primary infection
	3. Antivody testing is positive in non-primary disease
6. Chancroid:
	1. Rare, sexually transmitted infection due to Haemophilus ducreyi
	2. Small, gram negative rod

### Anogenital Warts
1. Caused by **papillomavirus (6, 11)**

| Special stains        | Giemsa                                                | None                                                        |
| Identification        | Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)                | Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)                      |
| Test samples          | Vaginal swab, urine, rectal swab                       | Urine, urethral swab (men), vaginal or cervical swab (women) |
| Culture               | Not routinely done                                     | Done only for antibiotic resistance testing                  |
| Microscopic view      |No visible bacteria, as they live inside cells|Visible intacellular gram-negatve diplococci, often found in pairs or clusters|

**Syphilis:**
1. Non-treponemal serologic tests:
	1. Screening test, if positive do [[#^8e56c0|teppenemal serological test]]. Do Teppnemal first if primary
	2. Semi-quantittive results reported as titer
	3. Tests for reaction of serum to cardiolipin antigen
	4. If syphillis antibodies present --> reaction
	5. False positive occurs in viral infections, others
	6. Examples:
		1. VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test
		2. RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test
3. Teppnemal serologic tests ^8e56c0
	1. Detects antiboties against specific treponemal antigents
	2. Examples:
		1. Fluorescent reponemal antiody absorption FTA-ABS
		2. T, pallidum enzyme immonaassay TP-EIA
	3. Qualitative test: So shows "Reactive" or "Non-reactive"
	4. Better test in primary disease with chancre
4. Neurosyphillis:
	1. Do Lumbar puncture
		1. This is because Blood test do not necessarily indicate CNS disease
	2. CSF for VDRL is highly specific for neurosphillys

**Genital Herpes**:
1. Preferred test: PCR for viral DNA
	1. Requires samlpe of vesicular fluid
	2. Alternative: Viral culture
2. Serological antibody testing:
	1. Useful when lesions have resolved
	2. Not for primary disease
	3. As such, Negative serology + PCR = primary disease

**Chancroid**:
1. Testing not often evailable
2. Normally found if symptoms are similar to chancroid, but negative testing for HSV

# Management
## Treatment

### Chlamydia management:
1. Special cell walls, lack peptidoglycan
	1. Do not respond to antibiotics.
	2. Treatment is azithromycin and doxycycline
		1. Pregnancy: Azithromycin, as doxy is bad for pregnancy
2. Test of N. Gonorrhoeae as often co-infected
3. Must treat partners or reinfection occurs

**Lymphogranuloma Venereum** management:
1. Drain buboes
2. Treat with antibiotics
	1. Doxycycline
	2. Azithromycin

### Gonorrhea management:
1. Ceftriaxone:
	1. Lowest frequency of treatment failure
	2. Given as single IM dose
2. Co-infection of [[#Chlamydia:]] is common
	1. Test and treat chlamydia
3. Evaluate and treat sexual partners

### Syphillis management:
**Acute:**
1. Give them benzathine penicillin G IM. If cannot tolerate, give doxycycline or ceftriaxone
2. If neurosyphillis, give aqueous crystalline penicillin G IV. Can also give probenecid as it inhibits renal from excreting penicillin
3. VDRL and RPR titers will fall
4. Treatment can cause Jarish-Herxheimer reaction:
	1. FLu-like syndorme after startig antibiotics
	2. Due to killed bacteria causing immune response
	3. Self-limited

**Long-term:**
1.  Regular monitoring: Patients with syphilis require regular blood tests to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and ensure that the infection is fully cleared.
2.  Partner notification: Sexual partners of patients diagnosed with syphilis should be notified and offered testing and treatment if necessary.
3.  Safe sex practices: Patients with syphilis should be advised to practice safe sex to prevent re-infection or transmission to others.
4.  Avoiding alcohol and drug use: Substance abuse can interfere with treatment and exacerbate symptoms of syphilis.
5.  Vaccinations: Patients with syphilis may be advised to receive vaccinations against hepatitis A and B, as well as human papillomavirus (HPV).

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timing of Treatment                                                   | Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible for people experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, or those who have experienced previous episodes but have not yet been diagnosed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| First-Line Treatment                                                  | Oral aciclovir 400mg, three times daily for 7-10 days or until lesions have healed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Alternative Treatments                                                |Valaciclovir and famciclovir can be used in place of aciclovir.|
| Additional Treatments                                                 |Topical treatments such as lidocaine gel or topical anaesthetic creams may be used to relieve pain and discomfort associated with lesions. Systemic analgesics such as paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also be used to manage pain. |
| Sexual Contact                                                        |Patients with genital herpes should be advised to avoid sexual contact during the acute phase of the illness or until all lesions have healed in order to reduce the risk of transmission to others. |
| Recurrent Episodes                                                     |People with recurrent episodes of genital herpes may benefit from suppressive antiviral therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks.|
1. Important to note, it does not eliminate  latent viral infection
2. Chronic suppressive therapy can be used if >6 episodes per year

### Chancroid:
1. Azithromycin is the recommended first-line treatment, given as a single dose of 1 gram orally. Alternatively, a 7-day course of erythromycin can be used.
-   Ceftriaxone is an alternative option for severe or complicated infections:  Single IM of 250mg.

### Anogential warts:
Sure, here are the key points for treating genital warts according to the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines:
- Treatment should be guided by the size, number, and location of warts
- Topical treatments include:
	- imiquimod cream
		- toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist that activates immune cells to produce cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that stimulate the immune system to attack the virus causing the warts
	- podophyllotoxin solution or gel
		- Cytotoxic agent that works by binding to and inhibiting microtubule formation, which is essential for cell division and growth.
	- sinecatechins ointment.
		- 
- Physical treatments include:
	- cryotherapy (freezing the warts with liquid nitrogen),:
	- surgical excision
	- laser therapy.
- Combination therapy may be more effective than monotherapy.
- Treatment may need to be repeated, and follow-up should occur until the warts have resolved.
- Treatment does not cure HPV infection, and patients should be advised on safe sex practices and regular screening for STIs.
- Referral to a specialist may be necessary for complex cases.
