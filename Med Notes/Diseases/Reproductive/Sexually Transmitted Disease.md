# Information
Sexually Transmitted Disease is infections spread by specific diseases. These include:
1. Chlamydia

### Chlamydia:
1. Special cell walls, lack peptidoglycan
	1. Do not respond to antibiotics.
	2. Treatment is azithromycin and doxycycline
2. 3 forms
	1. C. trachomatis
		1. Most common STI form
		2. Conjuctivitis and pneumonia in babies. Spread through birth canal
		3. Causes [[Lymphogranuloma venereum]] and [[Trachoma]]
			1. ![[Pasted image 20230513215402.png]]
	2. C pneumonia
		1. Atypical pneumonia by aerosol
	3. C psittaci
		1. Parrot fever, infection from birds

#### Lymphogranuloma Venereum:
1. Sexually transmitted chlamydia infection, spreads through lymphacs
2. Serotype L1, L2, L3
3. Initially painless genital ulcer, becomes tender inguinal or femoral lymph nodes
	1. Called "Buboes"

### N. Gonorrhoea:
1. Stain: Gram neg diplococci
2. Second most common STI
3. Causes urethritis and cervicitis
4. Causes proctitis and **pharyngitis**
5. Can disseminate, cause **arthritis**
	1. Non STI form: N. Meningitidis, causes meningitis

### Syphillis
1. Caused by Trponema pallidum, a spirochete
2. Can infect newborns (Called congenital syphilis)
3. Three stages: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary
	1. Primary: 2-3 weeks
		1. Painless chancre
		1. Ulcer, on penis
		2. Raised, 1-2cm
		3. Resolves spontaneously
	2. Secondary: 25% of primary
		1. Flu-like symptoms
			1. Headache, malaise, sre throat
		2. Rash, all extemities, maculopapular rash including palsm and soles
		3. Resolves spontaneously
		4. Diffuse lymphadenopathy
			1. Classically in epitrochlear nodes (elbow), called sailor's handshae
		5. Condylomata lata
			1. Raised, large, gray regions
			2. Found in moist areas, like mouth and periniom
	3. Late: YEars after
		1. Tertiary syphillis

# Management
## Treatment

### Chlamydia management:
1. Special cell walls, lack peptidoglycan
	1. Do not respond to antibiotics.
	2. Treatment is azithromycin and doxycycline
		1. Pregnancy: Azithromycin, as doxy is bad for pregnancy
2. Test of N. Gonorrhoeae as often co-infected
3. Must treat partners or reinfection occurs

**Lymphogranuloma Venereum** management:
1. Drain buboes
2. Treat with antibiotics
	1. Doxycycline
	2. Azithromycin

### Gonorrhea management:
1. Ceftriaxone:
	1. Lowest frequency of treatment failure
	2. Given as single IM dose
2. Co-infection of [[#Chlamydia:]] is common
	1. Test and treat chlamydia
3. Evaluate and treat sexual partners

### Syphillis management:
**Acute:**
| Disease Stage | Treatment | Dose | Route | Duration | Penicillin Allergy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Syphilis** | Benzathine penicillin G | 2.4 million units | IM | Single dose | Consider desensitization or doxycycline if allergic |
| **Secondary Syphilis** | Benzathine penicillin G | 2.4 million units | IM | Weekly for 3 weeks | Consider desensitization or doxycycline if allergic |
| **Early Latent Syphilis** | Benzathine penicillin G | 2.4 million units | IM | Weekly for 3 weeks | Consider desensitization or doxycycline if allergic |
| **Late Latent Syphilis** | Benzathine penicillin G | 2.4 million units | IM | Weekly for 3 weeks | Consider desensitization or doxycycline if allergic |
| **Tertiary Syphilis** | Benzathine penicillin G | 2.4 million units | IM | Weekly for 3 weeks | Consider desensitization or doxycycline if allergic |
| **Neurosyphilis** | Aqueous crystalline penicillin G | 18-24 million units | IV | 10-14 days | Desensitization required if allergic |

**Long-term:**
1.  Regular monitoring: Patients with syphilis require regular blood tests to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and ensure that the infection is fully cleared.
2.  Partner notification: Sexual partners of patients diagnosed with syphilis should be notified and offered testing and treatment if necessary.
3.  Safe sex practices: Patients with syphilis should be advised to practice safe sex to prevent re-infection or transmission to others.
4.  Avoiding alcohol and drug use: Substance abuse can interfere with treatment and exacerbate symptoms of syphilis.
5.  Vaccinations: Patients with syphilis may be advised to receive vaccinations against hepatitis A and B, as well as human papillomavirus (HPV).
