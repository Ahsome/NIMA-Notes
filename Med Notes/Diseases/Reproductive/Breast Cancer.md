# History
### Symptoms

### Risk factors:
**Modifiable Risk Factors**:
1. **[[Obesity]]**
2. **Alcohol**
3. **Smoking**
4. Physical inactivity
5. [[Hormone replacement therapy]] - If contains estrogen
6. Reproductive history

**All Risk Factor**
1. Female sex (99% of cases)
2. First deree relative with breast cancer
3. Age
4. Alcohol
5. Smoking
6. **Increased estrogen exposure**
	1. Early menarche, due to more menstal cycles
	2. Late menopause, due to more menstal cycles
	3. Obesity, adipose tissue converts androgen to estrogen
	4. Breast feeding = protective, as do not ovulate
7. **Age at first live birth**
	1. Young (<20) = Protective
	2. Older (>35) = Higher Risk

### Peau d'orange
[[#Peau d'orange]] is tumor invasion of dermal lymphatic vessels, preventing drainage. It is often **high grade** with **poor prognosis**
Symptoms include:
- Dimpling of skin, similar to orange rind
- Erthyema, swelling, that **has no response to antibiotics** after initial diagnosis of infection
- Itchy or painful

### Paget Disease
Paget Disease comes from erythema of nipple, due to underlying malignancy. It can cause bloody nipple discharge
Often mistaken for [[Eczema]] or [[Contact Dermatitis]]

[[#Paget disease management:|Management]] involves mammography. 50% of cases have palpable masses, but even with no masses there should be mammography. Stand

# Management
## Peau d'orange management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as dimpling of skin. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Diagnostic mammography +/- USS

## Paget disease management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as erythema at nipple and bloody nipple discharge. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Skin biopsy
	1. Should show **Paget cells**: Intraepithelial adenocacinoma cells
3. Mammography, found in 50% of cases
	1. If positive palpable
