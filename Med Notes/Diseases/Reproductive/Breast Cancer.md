# Information
Breast Cancer is the **most common carcinoma** in women, and **second most deadly** in women. It is *usually* adenocarcinoma from epithelial cells. It is *often* identified in **asymptomatic** stage by screening
It is mostly a disease of older women:
- Rare before age 25
- Incidence increases after age 30
- Median age at diagnosis: 62 years

Screening is recommended for women depeding on age:
![[#^eb8d54]]

It can rarely occur in men

## Forms of Breast Cancer
There are two main forms of breast carcinoma. They can be *in situ* (limited by basement membrane) or *invasive*:
1. Ductal carcinoma, resemble duct cells in breast
2. Lobular carcinoma, resemble lobules in breast

Th

There are two other variants/effects of cancer:
1. [[#Peau d'orange]]
2. [[#Paget Disease]]

## Dutal

### Peau d'orange
[[#Peau d'orange]] is tumor invasion of dermal lymphatic vessels, preventing drainage. It is often **high grade** with **poor prognosis**
Symptoms include:
- Dimpling of skin, similar to orange rind
- Erthyema, swelling, that **has no response to antibiotics** after initial diagnosis of infection
- Itchy or painful

### Paget Disease
Paget Disease comes from erythema of nipple, due to underlying malignancy. It can cause bloody nipple discharge
Often mistaken for [[Eczema]] or [[Contact Dermatitis]]

[[#Paget disease management:|Management]] involves mammography. 50% of cases have palpable masses, but even with no masses there should be mammography.

## Breast Cancer Screening
### Mammography
It detects **micro-calcifications**, which mostly occur in malignant lesions.
![[Pasted image 20230518010624.png]]
It can also occur in non-malignant lesion. If found, biopsy is done to identify if malignant. Causes include:
- [[Fat necrosis]]
- [[Sclerosing adenosis]]

# History
### Symptoms
1. ***Mass on breast***. See [[#Examination findings]] for specific information

### Risk factors:
**Modifiable Risk Factors**:
1. **[[Obesity]]**
2. **Alcohol**
3. **Smoking**
4. Physical inactivity
5. [[Hormone replacement therapy]] - If contains estrogen
6. Reproductive history

**All Risk Factor**
1. Female sex (99% of cases)
2. First deree relative with breast cancer
3. Age
4. Alcohol
5. Smoking
6. **Increased estrogen exposure**
	1. Early menarche, due to more menstal cycles
	2. Late menopause, due to more menstal cycles
	3. Obesity, adipose tissue converts androgen to estrogen
	4. Breast feeding = protective, as do not ovulate
7. **Age at first live birth**
	1. Young (<20) = Protective
	2. Older (>35) = Higher Risk

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any ???"*

# Management
## Standard Management for Mass:

## Peau d'orange management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as dimpling of skin. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Diagnostic mammography +/- USS

## Paget disease management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as erythema at nipple and bloody nipple discharge. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Skin biopsy
	1. Should show **Paget cells**: Intraepithelial adenocacinoma cells
3. Mammography, found in 50% of cases
	1. If positive palpable mass and mammogram:
		1. Proceed with [[#Standard Management for Mass:]]
	2. If no mass/lesion:
		1. Mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy
		2. Most have DCIS, about 25% have invasive cancer

# Complications
1. [[Lung cancer]]: Due to the radiation therapy for breast cancer, it can be a risk factor for lung cancer.
