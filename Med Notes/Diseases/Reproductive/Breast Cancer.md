# Information
Breast Cancer is the **most common carcinoma** in women, and **second most deadly** in women. It is *usually* adenocarcinoma from epithelial cells. It is *often* identified in **asymptomatic** stage by screening
It is mostly a disease of older women:
- Rare before age 25
- Incidence increases after age 30
- Median age at diagnosis: 62 years

Screening is recommended for women depeding on age:
![[#^eb8d54]]

It can rarely occur in men

## Forms of Breast Cancer
There are two main forms of breast carcinoma. They can be *in situ* (limited by basement membrane) or *invasive*:
1. Ductal carcinoma, resemble duct cells in breast
2. Lobular carcinoma, resemble lobules in breast

There can also be premalignant lesions associated with significantly increased risk of subsequent cancer:
- Ductal carcinoma in situ
- Lobular carcinoma in situ
- Atypical hyperplasia

There are two other variants/effects of cancer:
1. [[#Peau d'orange]]
2. [[#Paget Disease]]

---

### Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
This is the **most common type** (~80%) of invasive carcinoma
Biopsy identifies **duct cells with stroma**
It most commonly occurs in the **outer quadrant of breast**, as it has more breast tissue:

![[Pasted image 20230518021723.png]]

---

### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma
This is the **second common type** (~20%) of invasive carcinoma
Biopsy will show:
- Cells growing in single file
- Lack of E-cadherin adhesion protein expression
- Cells cannot stick together in clumps

![[Pasted image 20230518022214.png]]

It is often **bilateral**, with multiple lesions

---

### Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)
Ductual Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) is malignant growth cells of Terminal Duct Lobular Unit
75% of cases are ER positive
They fill the ductal lumen, but are limited by intact basement membrane:

![[Pasted image 20230518013617.png]]
*Biopsy of [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]]. Notice limited by basement membrane*

It forms **microcalcifications**, that can be detected by [[#Mammography]]
- Contrast with [[#Lobular Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]] and [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which *lacks micro-calcifications*
- Many subtypes, based on histology

It is important to note it is a **pre-malignant lesion**:
- If left untouched, it will develop to malignant lesion
- Contrast with [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]] and [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which is *not* a pre-malignant lesion, but identification is a risk factor for other invasive [[Breast Cancer]]

---

### Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)
Proliferation of cells in ducts/lobules, that are limited by intact basememnt membrane
- Exhibits "Discohesive growth": With loose intercellular connections
- Loss of adhesion prtein E-cadherin
- Round cells clumped together
- Often an incidental finding on biopsy

![[Pasted image 20230518015241.png]]

It has two forms based on histology, that affect [[#LCIS Management:|management]]:
1. Classic form
2. Non-classic form

It lacks **microcalcifications**, so it *cannot* be detected by [[#Mammography]]
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which *has micro-calcifications*
- Similar to [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which *lacks microcalcifications*

It is important to note it is a ***not*** **a pre-malignant lesion**:
- If left untouched, it will ***not develop*** to malignant lesion
- Rather, it identifies a risk of bilaterial lesions later in life
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which is a pre-malignant lesion
- Similar to [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which *is* ***not*** *a pre-malignant lesion* 

---

### Atypical Hyperplasia:
Atypical hyperplasia is often an **incidental finding on biopsy** for other reasons.
It has a **substantial increase** in risk of subsequent breast cancer

![[Pasted image 20230518021501.png]]

It comes in two forms:
1. Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)
2. Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)

It lacks **microcalcifications**, so it *cannot* be detected by [[#Mammography]]
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which *has micro-calcifications*
- Similar to [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]], which *lacks microcalcifications*

It is important to note it is a ***not*** **a pre-malignant lesion**:
- If left untouched, it will ***not develop*** to malignant lesion
- Rather, it identifies a risk of bilaterial lesions later in life
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which is a pre-malignant lesion
- Similar to [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]], which *is* ***not*** *a pre-malignant lesion* 

---

### Peau d'orange
[[#Peau d'orange]] is tumor invasion of dermal lymphatic vessels, preventing drainage. It is often **high grade** with **poor prognosis**
Symptoms include:
- Dimpling of skin, similar to orange rind
- Erthyema, swelling, that **has no response to antibiotics** after initial diagnosis of infection
- Itchy or painful

![[Pasted image 20230518005216.png]] ^e9f622

---

### Paget Disease
Paget Disease comes from erythema of nipple, due to underlying malignancy. It can cause bloody nipple discharge
Often mistaken for [[Eczema]] or [[Contact Dermatitis]]

[[#Paget disease management:|Management]] involves mammography. 50% of cases have palpable masses, but even with no masses there should be mammography.

![[Pasted image 20230518013938.png]]

---

## Breast Cancer Screening
### Mammography
It detects **micro-calcifications**, which mostly occur in malignant lesions.
![[Pasted image 20230518010624.png]]
It can also occur in non-malignant lesion. If found, biopsy is done to identify if malignant. Causes include:
- [[Fat necrosis]]
- [[Sclerosing adenosis]]

**Screening guidelines**:
![[Pasted image 20230518010724.png]] ^eb8d54

> [!Important]
- [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]] is a premalignant lesion that can develop to a malignant lesion. [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]] is *not* a plemalignant lesion, it will *not* develop to a malignant lesion, but is a risk factor for further lesion

# History
### Symptoms
1. ***Mass on breast***. See [[#Examination findings]] for specific information

### Risk factors:
**Modifiable Risk Factors**:
1. **[[Obesity]]**
2. **Alcohol**
3. **Smoking**
4. Physical inactivity
5. [[Hormone replacement therapy]] - If contains estrogen
6. Reproductive history

**All Risk Factor**
1. Female sex (99% of cases)
2. First deree relative with breast cancer
3. Age
4. Alcohol
5. Smoking
6. **Increased estrogen exposure**
	1. Early menarche, due to more menstal cycles
	2. Late menopause, due to more menstal cycles
	3. Obesity, adipose tissue converts androgen to estrogen
	4. Breast feeding = protective, as do not ovulate
7. **Age at first live birth**
	1. Young (<20) = Protective
	2. Older (>35) = Higher Risk
8. [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]]
	1. Now higher risk for bilateral [[Breast Cancer]]

# Management
## Standard Management for Mass:
### Further details:
**Mastectomy**: ^req1q6
- Removal of entire affected breast
- Often used when biopsy indicates a form of [[Breast Cancer]] that when identified, has already likely spread to the surrounding breast

**Breast-conserving therapy**: ^wr0f30
- Lumpectomy + radiation therapy
- Normally lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy
- Positive margins require re-excision
---

## Malignant Management:
### Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Management:
Treatment is based on **TNM** stage, but can include:
1. Surgery, such as [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]
2. Chemotherapy
3. Hormone therapy

### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Management:
Treatment is based on **TNM** stage, but can include:
1. Surgery, such as [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]
2. Chemotherapy
3. Hormone therapy

---

## Pre-malignant Management:
### DCIS Management:
1. [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]
2. ER-positive cases: Found in 75% of cases, use chemoprevention
	1. Chemoprevention blocks growth of tissue that have the ER-positive tissue in breast

### LCIS Management:
- Classic form: ^0111e7
	- Surveillance and chemoprevention ^051576
		- This is because LCIS does not progress to maligancy, just increases the chance of malignancy
		- Annual mammograms
		- Twice-yearly breast exams
		- **Stop** oral contraceptives, avoid HRT
			- These stimulate breast growth
		- SERMs or aromatase inhibitors
- Non-classical form:
	- Surgical excision via [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]

### Atypical Hyperplasia Management:
Similar to [[#^0111e7|classic form of LCIS]], with risk reduction strategies:
![[#^051576]]


---
## Other management:
## Peau d'orange management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as dimpling of skin. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Diagnostic mammography +/- USS

## Paget disease management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as erythema at nipple and bloody nipple discharge. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Skin biopsy
	1. Should show **Paget cells**: Intraepithelial adenocacinoma cells
3. Mammography, found in 50% of cases
	1. If positive palpable mass and mammogram:
		1. Proceed with [[#Standard Management for Mass:]]
	2. If no mass/lesion:
		1. Mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy
		2. Most have DCIS, about 25% have invasive cancer
