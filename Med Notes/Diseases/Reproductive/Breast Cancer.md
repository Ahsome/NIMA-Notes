# Information
Breast Cancer is the **most common carcinoma** in women, and **second most deadly** in women. It is *usually* adenocarcinoma from epithelial cells. It is *often* identified in **asymptomatic** stage by screening
It is mostly a disease of older women:
- Rare before age 25
- Incidence increases after age 30
- Median age at diagnosis: 62 years

It can rarely occur in men

It is important to note the [[#Standard Management for Mass:]]. This includes:
![[Breast Cancer#^6xl5oz]]

Screening is recommended for women depending on age:
![[#^eb8d54]]

## Forms of Breast Cancer
There are two main forms of breast carcinoma. They can be *in situ* (limited by basement membrane) or *invasive*:
1. Ductal carcinoma, resemble duct cells in breast
2. Lobular carcinoma, resemble lobules in breast

There can also be premalignant lesions associated with significantly increased risk of subsequent cancer:
- Ductal carcinoma in situ
- Lobular carcinoma in situ
- Atypical hyperplasia

| Details              | [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]] | [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]]          | [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]] |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Microcalcifications  | Yes                                  | No                                             | No                         |

| Pre-malignent lesion | Yes                                  | No                                             | No                         |
| Treatment            | Excision                             | Classic: Surveillence<br>Non-classic: Excision | Surveillence                           |

There are two other variants/effects of cancer:
1. [[#Peau d'orange]]
2. [[#Paget Disease]]

---

### Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
This is the **most common type** (~80%) of invasive carcinoma
Biopsy identifies **duct cells with stroma**
It most commonly occurs in the **outer quadrant of breast**, as it has more breast tissue:

![[Pasted image 20230518021723.png]]

---

### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma
This is the **second common type** (~20%) of invasive carcinoma
Biopsy will show:
- Cells growing in single file
- Lack of E-cadherin adhesion protein expression
- Cells cannot stick together in clumps

![[Pasted image 20230518022214.png]]

It is often **bilateral**, with multiple lesions

---

### Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)
Ductual Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) is malignant growth cells of Terminal Duct Lobular Unit
75% of cases are ER positive
They fill the ductal lumen, but are limited by intact basement membrane:

![[Pasted image 20230518013617.png]]
*Biopsy of [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]]. Notice limited by basement membrane*

It forms **microcalcifications**, that can be detected by [[#Mammography]]
- Contrast with [[#Lobular Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]] and [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which *lacks micro-calcifications*
- Many subtypes, based on histology

It is important to note it is a **pre-malignant lesion**:
- If left untouched, it will develop to malignant lesion
- Contrast with [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]] and [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which is *not* a pre-malignant lesion, but identification is a risk factor for other invasive [[Breast Cancer]]

---

### Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)
Proliferation of cells in ducts/lobules, that are limited by intact basememnt membrane
- Exhibits "Discohesive growth": With loose intercellular connections
- Loss of adhesion prtein E-cadherin
- Round cells clumped together
- Often an incidental finding on biopsy

![[Pasted image 20230518015241.png]]

It has two forms based on histology, that affect [[#LCIS Management:|management]]:
1. Classic form
2. Non-classic form

It lacks **microcalcifications**, so it *cannot* be detected by [[#Mammography]]
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which *has micro-calcifications*
- Similar to [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which *lacks microcalcifications*

It is important to note it is a ***not*** **a pre-malignant lesion**:
- If left untouched, it will ***not develop*** to malignant lesion
- Rather, it identifies a risk of bilaterial lesions later in life
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which is a pre-malignant lesion
- Similar to [[#Atypical Hyperplasia:]], which *is* ***not*** *a pre-malignant lesion* 

---

### Atypical Hyperplasia:
Atypical hyperplasia is often an **incidental finding on biopsy** for other reasons.
It has a **substantial increase** in risk of subsequent breast cancer

![[Pasted image 20230518021501.png]]

It comes in two forms:
1. Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)
2. Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)

It lacks **microcalcifications**, so it *cannot* be detected by [[#Mammography]]
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which *has micro-calcifications*
- Similar to [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]], which *lacks microcalcifications*

It is important to note it is a ***not*** **a pre-malignant lesion**:
- If left untouched, it will ***not develop*** to malignant lesion
- Rather, it identifies a risk of bilaterial lesions later in life
- Contrast with [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]], which is a pre-malignant lesion
- Similar to [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]], which *is* ***not*** *a pre-malignant lesion* 

---

### Peau d'orange
[[#Peau d'orange]] is tumor invasion of dermal lymphatic vessels, preventing drainage. It is often **high grade** with **poor prognosis**
Symptoms include:
- Dimpling of skin, similar to orange rind
- Erthyema, swelling, that **has no response to antibiotics** after initial diagnosis of infection
- Itchy or painful

![[Pasted image 20230518005216.png]] ^e9f622

---

### Paget Disease
Paget Disease comes from erythema of nipple, due to underlying malignancy. It can cause bloody nipple discharge
Often mistaken for [[Eczema]] or [[Contact Dermatitis]]

[[#Paget disease management:|Management]] involves mammography. 50% of cases have palpable masses, but even with no masses there should be mammography.

![[Pasted image 20230518013938.png]]

---

### Male Breast Cancer
Male breast cancer has an incidence rate of 1% compared to women, usually at 60 to 70 years of age
It presents as **subareolar mass +/- discharge**. This is due to most breast tissue in males present at nipple

Key associations:
- [[Klienfelter syndrome]] (3-8%)
	- Tall, hypogonadism
- BRCA2 gene mutations (4-14%)

> [!Important]
- [[#Ductul Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)]] is a premalignant lesion that can develop to a malignant lesion. [[#Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)]] is *not* a plemalignant lesion, it will *not* develop to a malignant lesion, but is a risk factor for further lesion
- Tamoxifen is preferred in **premenopausal women**, aromatase inibitors are not effective

### Breast Cancer Screening
#### *Mammography*
It detects **micro-calcifications**, which mostly occur in malignant lesions.
![[Pasted image 20230518010624.png]]
It can also occur in non-malignant lesion. If found, biopsy is done to identify if malignant. Causes include:
- [[Fat necrosis]]
- [[Sclerosing adenosis]]

**Screening guidelines**:
![[Pasted image 20230518010724.png]] ^eb8d54

#### *Familial Breast Cancer*
Familial breast cancer causes around 10% of breast cancer.
- Caused by mutations in **BRCA1** and **BRCA2**
- These code for DNA repair proteins
- Autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance
	- Not all individuals with disease mutation develop disease
- Associated with other malignancies:
	- BRCA1: [[Ovarian Cancer]]
	- BRCA2: [[Breast Cancer|Male]], [[Pancreatic Cancer]] 
---

### Prognosis:
**Prognosis** depends two main components:
- Lymph node metastases, and is the *most important prognostic factor*
	- Detected by biopsy
	- Sentinel node biopsy often performed
		- Tracer is applied near lesion, which will move to certain lymph nodes, called sentinel nodes
		- If sentinel nodes are free, no need to get other lymph nodes
	- Provides **staging**
- [[#Tumor Markers:]] present:
	- Presenting any of the receptors improves chances
	- [[#^9bfefd|Tripple negative]] having the worst outcomes

**Staging**: ^c01c22
- Depends on tumor size, node amount, and metastasis
- Stave IV carries worst prognosis, when metastases occurs
- Lymph node amount is split into three categories:
	- **Category 1:**
		- Breast cancer cells have been found in one to three lymph nodes in the armpit. 
	- **Category 2:**   
		- Breast cancer cells have been found in:
		- 4–9 lymph nodes in the armpit, and the lymph nodes are also enlarged, and/or attached to each other or to nearby tissue; or
		- 1 or more lymph nodes under the breastbone, but not in any lymph nodes in the armpit. 
	- **Category 3:**   
		- Breast cancer cells have been found in:
		- 10 or more lymph nodes in the armpit; or
		- 1 or more lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or
		- 1 or more lymph nodes under the breastbone and 1 or more lymph nodes in the armpit.

### Tumor Markers:
Tumor markers are important for **prognosis and therapy**, but less important than [[#^aae707|TNM stage]]
It has three types:
1. Estrogen receptor positive (ER+)
2. Progesterone receptor positive (PR+)
3. Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)

For patients with **ER+** and/or **PR+** tumors: "Chemoprevention", or "endocrine therapy is used ^458dca
- Oral drugs:
	- [[Breast Cancer#^adc644|Tamoxifen]]: Selective estrogen receptor modulator ([[SERM]])
	- [[Breast Cancer#^vb14o8|Aromatase inhibitors]]
- Normally patients are *either* **positive for both**, or **negative for both**. *Sometimes only one is present*

For patients with **HER2+**: May respond to [[Breast Cancer#^0r6lh4|trastuzumab]] ^rjoeas
- Infusion therapy
- Monoclonal antibody targeting HER2

For patients that are **tripple negative**: ^9bfefd
- Highly aggressive
- More common in women under 40

---

### Drugs
**Tamoxifen**: ^adc644
- Selective estrogen receptor modulator ([[SERM]])
- Competitive antagonist of breast estrogen receptor
- Used in [[#^458dca|ER+]] breast cancer
- Estrogen *agonist* in other tissues (bone/uterus), hence **selective** estrogen receptor modulator
- **Preferred in** *premenopausal women*
	- This is due to [[Breast Cancer#^vb14o8|aromatase inhibitors]] **not being effective in this group**
- Adverse effects:
	- **Commonly** causes **hot flashes**, by decreasing effects of estrogen
	- Increased risk of [[Pulmonary Embolus|PE/DVT]], minor agonist effects of estrogen to cause coagulation. Similar to OCP
	- **Partial agonist to endometrium** ^ylhsh0
		- Causes endometrial prolfieration and hyperplasia
		- Leads to polyp formation (up to 36% of women)
		- Associated with [[Endometrial Cancer]]

**Aromatase Inhibitors:** ^vb14o8
- Used in [[#^458dca|ER+]] breast cancer among **postmenopausal** women
	- Works by blocking peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen. This is the **main** source of estroge post-menopause
	- Contrast with [[#^adc644|Tamoxifen]], which is for premenopausal women, and useful in high-estrogen states
- More effective than Tamoxifen in clinical trials
- Adverse effects: ^oszqvi
	- Increase risk of **osteoporosis** from loss of estrogen
	- Increase risk of **fracture**
- Examples:
	- Anastrozole
	- Letrozole
	- Exemestane

**Trastuzuab**: ^0r6lh4
- Also called **Herceptin**
- Monoclonal antiboy against [[Breast Cancer#^rjoeas|HER-2]]
	- HER-2 is a surface receptor
	- When activated, cause cell growth and proliferation
	- Overexpressed by cancer cells
- Improves survival in [[Breast Cancer#^rjoeas|HER-2+]] breast cancer
- Adverse effects
	- **Cardiomyopathy**
	- Leads to asymptomatic ⬇️ in LVEF
	- Rarely causes heart failure
	- Monitoring: Serial echocardiography
	- Different from cardiotoxicity due to **antracycline**, another possible chemo agent for breast ancer
		- Trastuzumab is **not dose dependent**, Antrhacycline is
		- Trastuzumab is **often reversible**, Antracycline is not
		- Re-challenge often tolerated after LVEF recovery for Trastuzumab
---

### Further details:
**Mastectomy**: ^req1q6
- Removal of entire affected breast
- Often used when biopsy indicates a form of breasy cancer that when identified, has already likely spread to the surrounding breast

**Breast-conserving therapy**: ^wr0f30
- Lumpectomy + radiation therapy
- Normally lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy
- Positive margins require re-excision

---
---

## Specific Management:
### Malignant Management:
#### Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Management:
Treatment is based on [[#^aae707|TNM stage]], but can include:
1. Surgery, such as [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]
2. Chemotherapy
3. Hormone therapy

#### Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Management:
Treatment is based on [[#^aae707|TNM stage]], but can include:
1. Surgery, such as [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]
2. Chemotherapy
3. Hormone therapy

---

### Pre-malignant Management:
#### DCIS Management:
1. [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]
2. [[#^458dca|ER+]] case: Found in 75% of cases, use chemoprevention
	1. Chemoprevention blocks growth of tissue that have the ER-positive tissue in breast

#### LCIS Management:
- Classic form: ^0111e7
	- Surveillance and chemoprevention ^051576
		- This is because LCIS does not progress to maligancy, just increases the chance of malignancy
		- Annual mammograms
		- Twice-yearly breast exams
		- **Stop** oral contraceptives, avoid HRT
			- These stimulate breast growth
		- [[Breast Cancer#^adc644|SERMs]] or [[Breast Cancer#^vb14o8|aromatase inhibitors]]
- Non-classical form:
	- Surgical excision via [[Breast Cancer#^req1q6|Mastectomy]] or [[Breast Cancer#^wr0f30|breast-conserving therapy]]

#### Atypical Hyperplasia Management:
Similar to [[#^0111e7|classic form of LCIS]], with risk reduction strategies:
![[#^051576]]

## Other management:
## Peau d'orange management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as dimpling of skin. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Exclude other causes of erythema and swelling of breast, such as **infections**. Do routine checks such as history of feer, WCC count etc.
3. Diagnostic mammography +/- USS
4. If present, follow management based on diagosis

## Paget disease management:
Steps of management include:
1. Initial presentation screening, look for symptoms such as erythema at nipple and bloody nipple discharge. See [[#Investigations]]
2. Skin biopsy
	1. Should show **Paget cells**: Intraepithelial adenocacinoma cells
3. Mammography, found in 50% of cases
	1. If positive palpable mass and mammogram:
		1. Proceed with [[#Standard Management for Mass:]]
	2. If no mass/lesion:
		1. Mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy
		2. Most have DCIS, about 25% have invasive cancer
