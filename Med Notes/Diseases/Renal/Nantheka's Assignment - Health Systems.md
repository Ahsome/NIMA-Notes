# Notes
- One of the goals with universal healthcare is to create a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest possible level of health.
- Japan Health System Review
	- Japan currently has a high standard of living, economic stability and level of development, in association with havinng the world's highest life expectancy. These acievements are in part due to it's large economy and high GDP, as well as it's universal health coverage system. These achievements, in addition to low birth rates, also mean that the country's population is ageing rapidly and shrinking. As a result, in recent decades there is an increased incidence of noncommunicablle and degenerative diseases, putting a new strain on the national healt system. These changes coupled with an economic deccelleration, means that there needs to be a shift in focus to balacing universal health insurance coverage, service quality and financial sustainability. 
	- Since Japan's introduction of the universall health insurance system in the 1961, citizens have been provided with comprehensive health coverage. This has lead to successes in health such as the control and eradication of certain infectious diseases including--------. 
	- However, population and demographic changes as well as inadqueate contorl of cost and quality of care within the health system has lead to a mismatch between quality and cost-effecitiveness in recent years, infouencing severall reforms in the past two decades in relation to service delivery and financing. 
	- These reforms include: 
		- Long-term care insurance system (2000) - a social insurance scheme for those aged above 65 years who require long-term care
		- Inegrated Community Care System (2006) - a comprehenssive public health model that integrates prevention, medical services and social services at the community level
		- The Comprehensive Reform of Society Security and Tax (2010) - a reform to improve the fiscal susttainability of healthcare which focuses on the support of child-raising, employment of young people, pension reform, measures afainst income ineuqality and access to healthcare 
		- Regional Healthcare Vision (2014) - focusing on regional healthcare systems to provide support for disease prevention and longterm care for the elderly in their respective communtiies 
	- A new proposed Japan Vision: Health Care 2035 further encourages a paradigm shift to a new more quitable and susbtainable healthcare model to deliver better health outcomes to all citizens of Japan. The focus of this model is to shift from quantity to qualiy and efficiency of care, as well as from specialised to integrated approaches across all sectors.
