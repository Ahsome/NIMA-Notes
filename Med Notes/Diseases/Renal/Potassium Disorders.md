# HYPERKALAEMIA

## Pathophysiology
### Potassium homeostasis
- Cellular – H+ in=K+ out
- Therefore acidaemia = hyperkalaemia
	- Vice versa also true
- Insulin pushes H+ out of cells, brings potassium back into the cell
- B2 agonist excretes Na+ --> K+ back into cells (antiporter)

### Renal
- Responsible for excretion
- TAL NaKCl2 reabsorption
- CD K+ excretion (aldosterone facilitates)

### Mechanisms of hyperkalaemia
- Spurious – left blood sample around for too long, haemolysis --> intracellular K+ release
- Increased load – potassium tablets, nearly never dietary
- Cellular shifts – acidaemia (very common), digoxin, suxamethonium
- Decreased excretion – renal failure (very common), Addison’s disease

### Clinical Presentation
Sudden cardiac death
Paraesthesia, nausea and vomiting, areflexia, ascending paralysis.

### Management
1. ECG and monitoring
- ECG changes – peaked T waves --> lose P wave --> widened QRS --> death
	- 6.5-7.5 = long PR, peaked T, short QTc
	- 7.5-8= flat P, wide QRS
	- 8= sine wave, VF, AV block, etc
- ==If ECG changes – give calcium gluconate or calcium chloride
	- Calcium – does not fix hyperkalaemia, however
		- ***Reduces threshold potential in myocytes***
	- Chloride – more potent, if giving peripheral can damage tissues
		- Need central access to give
	- Gluconate – less potent, more likely to be given peripherally
		- Liver required to convert to calcium in usable form
		- 10-20mLs
	- Calcium dose will last for 30-60 minutes
	- Contraindications – Hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia, digoxin

Concurrent management and investigations (principles of resuscitation)
2. Correct potassium
- Shifter’s
	- ==Insulin in dextrose
		- ==Onset 20 mins, lasts 4-6 hours==
	- ==Salbutamol
		- ==Onset 30 mins, lasts 2 hours
	- Both will drop K+ by about 0.6 mmol/L
- Excreters
	- ==Loop diuretic – frusemide
	- Resonium – binds and excretes potassium from gut
	- Dialysis
- Sodium bicarbonate
	- ==Drives K+ into cells (if acidaemic)
	- Sodium load will facilitate excretion K+ in distal nephron


1.  Identify and treat the underlying cause of hyperkalaemia.
2.  **Temporarily stabilize the cardiac membrane by administering calcium gluconate intravenously. This can reduce the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest in severe hyperkalaemia.**
3.  Promote the elimination of excess potassium from the body by one or more of the following methods: a. Administering insulin and glucose to shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells. b. Administering salbutamol (beta-2 agonist) nebulised or intravenously to shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells. c. Administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) orally or rectally, which binds to potassium in the gut and promotes its elimination through the feces. d. Administering loop diuretics such as frusemide intravenously or orally, which can promote the elimination of potassium through the urine. e. Administering haemodialysis in severe cases.

# HYPOKALAEMIA

The normal range for serum potassium levels is 3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L. Hypokalaemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level of **==less than 3.5 mmol/L==**. However, the severity of symptoms and complications may depend on the degree and duration of hypokalaemia.

The causes of hypokalaemia can be diverse and include excessive losses from the body due to **vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating**, as well as **insufficient intake through diet or impaired absorption**. Certain medications, such as **==diuretics, laxatives, or beta-agonists==**, can also cause hypokalaemia. In addition, certain medical conditions such as renal ***tubular acidosis, Cushing syndrome, and hyperaldosteronism*** can also lead to low potassium levels.

Symptoms of hypokalaemia may include muscle weakness, cramps, palpitations, irregular heartbeat, and fatigue. In severe cases, hypokalaemia can lead to paralysis, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.

Diagnosis of hypokalaemia is made through a blood test to measure serum potassium levels. Additional investigations may include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate heart rhythm and function, renal function tests, and blood magnesium levels.


Certainly, here is a table summarizing the causes, symptoms, investigations, and management options for hypokalaemia (low potassium levels in the blood):

## TREATMENT OF HYPOKALAEMIA
1.  Oral potassium supplementation is the preferred route of administration for mild to moderate hypokalaemia. For severe hypokalaemia or patients with significant symptoms, intravenous potassium may be required.
	1. SpanK
2.  The preferred oral potassium supplement is potassium chloride (KCl), administered in divided doses to a maximum of 240mmol per day. Patients with renal impairment or risk of hyperkalaemia should receive lower doses.
3.  Potassium supplementation should be accompanied by monitoring of serum potassium, magnesium, and renal function.
4.  It is important to avoid rapid correction of hypokalaemia, as this can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications. Correction should be gradual and monitored regularly.
