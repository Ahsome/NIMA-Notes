# Information
Pathophysiology
Potassium homeostasis
• Cellular – H+ in=K+ out
o Therefore acidaemiaàhyperkalaemia
§ Vice versa also true
o Insulin pushes H+ out of cells, brings potassium back into the cell
o B2 agonist excretes Na+àK+ back into cells (antiporter)
• Renal

o Responsible for excretion
o TAL NaKCl2 reabsorption
o CD K+ excretion (aldosterone facilitates)

Mechanisms
• Spurious – left blood sample around for too long, haemolysis à intracellular K+ release
• Increased load – potassium tablets, nearly never dietary
• Cellular shifts – acidaemia (very common), digoxin, suxamethonium
• Decreased excretion – renal failure (very common), Addison’s disease
Clinical Presentation
Sudden cardiac death
Paraesthesia, nausea and vomiting, areflexia, ascending paralysis.
Management
ECG and monitoring
• ECG changes – peaked T waves à lose P waveà widened QRS àdeath
o 6.5-7.5 = long PR, peaked T, short QTc
o 7.5-8= flat P, wide QRS
o >8= sine wave, VF, AV block, etc
• If ECG changes – give calcium gluconate or calcium chloride
o Calcium – does not fix hyperkalaemia, however
§ Reduces threshold potential in myocytes
o Chloride – more potent, if giving peripheral can damage tissues
§ Need central access to give
o Gluconate – less potent, more likely to be given peripherally
§ Liver required to convert to calcium in usable form
§ 10-20mLs
o Calcium dose will last for 30-60 minutes
o Contraindications – Hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia, digoxin
Concurrent management and investigations (principles of resuscitation)
Correct potassium
• Shifter’s
o Insulin in dextrose
§ Onset 20 mins, lasts 4-6 hours
o Salbutamol
§ Onset 30 mins, lasts 2 hours
o Both will drop K+ by about 0.6 mmol/L
• Excreters
o Loop diuretic – frusemide
o Resonium – binds and excretes potassium from gut
o Dialysis
• Sodium bicarbonate
o Drives K+ into cells (if acidaemic)

o Sodium load will facilitate excretion K+ in distal nephron
