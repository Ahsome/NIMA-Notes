# Information
 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a chronic decline in kidney function, usually defined by level of GFR and albuminuria. It is important to note that CKD can be caused by numerous diseases, and are often divided into nephirtic and nephrotic causes:

## *Nephritic syndrome features:*
-   **==Haematuria==** – microscopic initially (with casts) and macroscopic later. Often has recurrent bouts of haematuria.
-   **==Proteinuria < 3.5g==**/1.73m2/day – not the defining feature, but there is less than nephrotic.
-   **==Hypertension==** – due to damage to the glomerular apparatus, the RAAS system goes off and increases BP.
-   Oliguria – reduced frequency
-   Azotemia – build-up of urea and creatinine causes pruritis and encephalitis.
-   Associated diseases:
	- **Post strep glomerulonephritis  
	- **IgA nephropathy****  
	- Rapidly progressing (crescentic) – **Goodpasture’s** (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis  
	- Vasculitic disorder – Wegener’s granulomatosis/microscopic polyangiitis o SLE – can cause secondary glomerulonephritis  
	- Henoch Schonlein purpura – vasculitis resulting IgA deposition in skin and kidneys

## *Nephrotic syndrome features:*
-   **==Proteinuria > 3.5g==**/1.73m2/day – defining feature. Cloudy urine
	- **==Hypoalbuminaemia==**
-   Hyperlipidaemia – can result in lipiduria too
-   Global **==oedema==** – face, legs, pleura etc...
-   **==Hypercoagulability==** – loss of ANTICOAGULANT proteins such as antithrombin III and plasminogen in the urine pushes the balance towards pro-coagulability.
-   Primary causes – DIFFUSE GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS - minimal change, focal segmental, membranous
-   Secondary causes – SLE, Hep B, Hep C, HIV, diabetes

> [!Important]
- Nephritic - haematuria, proteinuria < 3.5g, HTN, post-strep, Goodpastruees (anti GBM) or IgA nephritis
- Nephrotic - proteinuria > 3.5g, oaedema, hypercoagulability, diffuse glomerulosclerosi, SLE, hepatitis, HIV, diabetes
- Most common cause of CKD = diabetes, then glomeruonephritis, then HTN
- Remember the triple whammy of kidney drugs (NSAIDs, ACEi, diuretics)
- Remember drug allterations if patient has CKD exxacerbation - some drugs don't work as well/are not cleared properly

## Pathophysiology
Most commonly diabetic nephropathy, gllomerulonephritis, or HTN 
- Diabetes – 33%
-   Glomerulonephritis – 24%
-   HTN – 14%
-   Polycystic kidneys – 7%
-   Reflux nephropathy
-   Other

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
As patients in CKD stage 1 to 3 (eGFR > 30) typically are asymptomatic for the most part. As CKD progresses past this, they will become symptomatic.
-   Urinary symptoms – nocturia, haematuria - *are you peeing at night and is there blood in your urine?*
-   Systemic symptoms – fluid retention, lethargy, loss of appetite, pruritis - *any increase in weight? any fatigue? anorexia? any itching of the skin?*
-   Uraemia – **anorexia, nausea, vomiting, encephalopathy, neuropathy, serositis**
- ==Have you been told what your kidney issues are?==

## Acute causes of deterioration of CKD
***Pre-renal causes:***  
- Internal vasoconstriction – usually drug induced (TRIPLE WHAMMY)
	- ==NSAIDs== – vasoconstriction of the **AFFERENT** arterioles, decreasing renal perfusion
	- ==ACEi or ARB== – vasodilation of the **EFFERENT** arterioles, reducing renal perfusion pressure and as a result decreasing eGFR overall.
	- ==Diuretics== – the addition of a diuretic like a loop diuretic such as frusemide can exacerbate kidney function with further decreases in perfusion.
- Cardiorenal syndrome – since the heart and kidneys are intimately connected in the control of haemodynamics, the failure in one can exacerbate the failure in the other. These patients usually have HF and coexisting CKD. There are 5 types:
	- Type 1 – acute HF causes AKI  
	- Type 2 – chronic HF causes gradual progression of CKD  
	- Type 3 – acute kidney dysfunction (for whatever reason) will cause acute heart failure  
	- Type 4 – primary CKD results in progressive HF  
	- Type 5 – a secondary disease, such as SLE, causes both HF and CKD
-   **Shock and haemodynamic collapse** – most commonly sepsis
-   Volume depletion
	- Diuretic overuse  
	- Extra-renal loss – profuse diarrhoea, vomiting and sweating

 ***Intrinsic renal causes:***
-   Glomerular – glomerulonephritis etc...
-   Medications that cause AKI:
	- Antibiotics – penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (gentamycin)
	- ==Contrast agents==

***Post-renal causes:***
- Bladder outlet obstruction – ==BPH, neurogenic bladder, cancer== (causing obstruction)
	- Hydronephrosis

## Investigations
Always check the following:
- Serum urea, creatinine, eGFR
- Urinalysis (dipstick) - urine albumin levels, RBC in urine
- USS KUB, CT KUB – structural cause?
- Full blood count – normocytic normochromic anaemia often observed in CKD
- ELFTs
-   Kidney function test:
	- Urea  
	- Creatinine 
	- eGFR
- **==ABG – can tell if kidney dysfunction has caused metabolic acidosis==**. pH, bicarb etc.
- Renal biopsy – if glomerulonephropathy considered

# Management
## Drug alterations in patients with CKD exacerbations
- **==Metformin==** – not to be used in eGFR < 30mL/min (Stage 4 and 5). Will cause lactic acidosis. As eGFR drop from >90 to >30, the dose of metformin needs to be reduced.
- Sulfonylureas – another drug that accumulates. It will cause HYPOs. 
- Cease ACEi or ARB in AKI on CKD – in the acute setting of acute on CKD, temporarily cease ACEi/ARB to maintain renal glomerular perfusion and allow eGFR to recover.
- NOACs/DOACs – these are renally excreted. With advanced CKD, NOACs will accumulate and cause catastrophic bleeding. There isn’t a reliable monitoring system for NOACs...
- Beta blockers – most of these, like atenolol and bisoprolol are renally excreted. Accumulation will cause bradycardia.
- Digoxin – another renally cleared drug. Its normal MOA is to prevent arrhythmias (AF) by blocking the AV node, so in CKD, this will accumulate and further suppress heart rate. Patients will be bradycardic and in severe cases, have heart block. DIGITOXICITY...
- Opioids – after accumulation, will cause respiratory depression.
- Antibiotic doses need to be adjusted – penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (gentamycin), as these can have nephrotoxic properties.
- Antivirals typically have nephrotoxic properties too.

Triple whammy - Beware the combined use of ACEi and ARBs together, as well as in conjunction with frusemide and NSAIDs.
