# Information
Urinary Incontinence is the **involuntary** loss of urine. Is it common in the elderly, and has **three** major patterns:
1. [[#Urge incontinence]]
2. [[#Stress incontinence]]
3. [[#Overflow incontinence]]

There are **key gender differences** regarding incontinence:
- Incontience is more common in women until age 80, before equalising
	- Normally due to weakened pelvic floor because of pregnancy
- For women:
	- Commonly [[#Stress incontinence]] or [[#Urge incontinence]] or mixed
- For men:
	- If [[Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)]] --> [[#Overflow incontinence]]
	- Weakened pelvic floor --> [[#Stress incontinence]]

### Urge incontinence
Urge incontinence (also called [[#Urge incontinence|overactive bladder]]) is the urge to void accompanied by loss of urine
- Due to detrusor muscle overactivity
- Involuntary contractions during bladder filling
- Clinical diagnosis

![[Pasted image 20230520002850.png]]
### Stress incontinence
This is loss of urine with increased abdominal pressure. It is caused by **weak pelvic floor muscles**, the increased pressure forces urine into urethra. This can happen during:
- Coughing
- Sneezing
- Heavy liftng
- Laughing

It is associated with:
1. [[Obesity]]
2. [[Pregnancy|Vaginal deliveries]]

### Overflow incontinence
This is associated with **urinary retention**, with **leakage of urine** from a full bladder.
The ***hallmark*** is ***elevated post-void residual***
- If, after voiding there is still urine in bladder, this can diagnose overflow incontence
- Can be checked via [[#Investigations|USS]]
The patient is unable to void fully, and has *persistent* small volume urine loss

Caused include:
- Detrusor underactivity
- Obstruction (men with [[Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)]])
- Medications (antihistamines, antimuscarinics)
- Neuropathy ([[Stroke]], [[Diabetes Mellitus]])

> [!Important]+ Summary
- It has three main forms: [[#Urge incontinence]], [[#Stress incontinence]] and [[#Overflow incontinence]]

# Management
## Urge incontinence Management
Management involves:
1. Kegel exercises
	1. Patients asked to control and hold sustained pelvic floor contractions
	2. Done several times per day, strengthen muscles over time
2. Medications
	1. Anticholinergics: oxybutynin, reduce parasympathetic innervation of detrusor muscle
		1. Contrast with [[#Overflow Incontinence Management]], which recommends cholinergic drugs
3. Neurostimulators
	1. Implanted devices
	2. Sacral nerves

## Stress Incontinence Management
Management involves:
1. Kegel exercises
	1. Patients asked to control and hold sustained pelvic floor contractions
	2. Done several times per day, strengthen muscles over time
2. Topical vaginal estrogen
	1. Post-menopausal, loss of estrogen causes breakdown of pelvic tissue
	2. Improves pelvic tissue
3. Pessary
	1. Vaginal support device
	2. ![[Pasted image 20230520013522.png|200]]
4. Surgery

## Overflow Incontinence Management
Management involves:
1. Treat underlying cause
	1. For [[Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)]], prostate surgery
	2. For medications, stop offending medications
2. Urinary catheterisation
3. Medications
	1. Cholinergic drugs: bethanechol, stimulates bladder
		1. Contrast with [[#Urge incontinence Management]], which recommends anticholinergic drugs
	2. Alpha-blockers: doxazosin, terazosin
4. Surgery
	1. Prostate resection
