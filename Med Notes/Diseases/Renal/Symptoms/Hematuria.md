# Information
Hematuria is **blood** in the urine
Key causes include:
1. **Stones**: Kidney stones, ureter stones, bladder stones
	1. Normally [[#Gross hematuria]]
2. **Infection:** [[Cystitis]], [[Pyelonephritis]]
	1. Normally [[#Non-glomerular bleeding]] and [[#Gross hematuria]]
3. Cancer: Kidney, Bladder
4. [[Glomerulonephritis]]
	1. Normally [[#Microscopic hematuria]]
5. Coagulopathy

It has **two** ways of categorising, such as by size:
1. [[#Microscopic hematuria]]
2. [[#Gross hematuria]]

It can also be categorised by **glomerular** involvement:
1. [[#Glomerular bleeding]]
2. [[#Non-glomerular bleeding]]

Other pigments that can cause **blood-looking** urine include:
- Myoglobin
	- Found in urine with [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
	- Turns urine red
	- Heme positive dipstick, but no RBCs on urinalysis
- Bilirubin
	- Hemolysis, biliary disease
	- Turns urine brown
	- Detected by dipstic
- Rifampin
	- TB drug
	- Turns urine orange

## Size
### Microscopic hematuria
This is see on urine microscopy, and is *often* due to **glomerular disease**
It can also be due to infection or [[Kidney stones]]
![[Pasted image 20230520015552.png|200]]

### Gross hematuria
It is **grossly** red urine, and is *often* caused by non-glomerular disease
It is ***always assumed to be [[Bladder cancer]] or [[Renal cancer]] until proven otherwise***

## Glomerular involvement
Summarised information:
| Sign       |[[#Glomerular bleeding]]|[[#Non-glomerular bleeding]]|
| ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Dysuria    | No                         | No                          |
| Flank pain | No                         | Yes                         |
| RBC        | RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs | Normal                      |
| Protein    | Present                    | No                          | 

### Glomerular bleeding
Signs include:
- This is more likely to be [[#Microscopic hematuria]]
- There is ***no*** dysuria or flank pain
	- If present, due to infection of bladder
- There are **RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs**
- Proteinuria
- Causes include [[Glomerulonephritis]]

### Non-glomerular bleeding
Signs include:
- More likely to be [[#Gross hematuria]]
- There **is dysuria and flank pain**
	- Dysuria is a sign of [[Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)]]
	- Flank pain is a sign of [[Pyelonephritis]]
- There are normal red cells
- No protein
- Causes include stones, [[Bladder cancer]], [[Renal cancer]], infection


> [!Important]+ Summary
- [[#Gross hematuria]] is ***always assumed to be [[Bladder cancer]] or [[Renal cancer]] until proven otherwise***
- If there is dysuria and flank pain, suggest a **infection** aetiology. Dysuria: [[Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)]], Flank pain: [[Pyelonephritis]]

# History
### Symptoms
1. Dysuria, flank pain
	1. **Only** with [[#Non-glomerular bleeding]], not [[#Glomerular bleeding]]
	2. Signs of dysuria or flank pain suggest a **infection aetiology**
		1. Dysuria: Think [[Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)]]
		2. Flank pain: Think [[Pyelonephritis]]

## Investigations

| Key Findings | Result   | Explanation   |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
|Urine dipstick|Heme|Likely [[Hematuria]]|
|^^|Protein present|More likely [[#Glomerular bleeding]]|
|^^ |Protein not present |More likely [[#Non-glomerular bleeding]] |
|^^|Bilirubin|Consider hemolysis or biliary disease instead of [[Hematuria]]|
|Urine microscopy|Dysmorphic RBCs|More likely [[#Glomerular bleeding]] <br> <br>Other casts besides RBC possible. SeeÂ [[Hematuria#^e8ijjp\|Types of Casts]]. <br> Particularly WBC can indicated [[Pyelonephritis]]|
|^^|RBC casts|^^ |
|^^ |Normal RBCs|More likely [[#Non-glomerular bleeding]]|
|^^|No RBCs|Consider [[Rhabdomyolysis]] instead of [[Hematuria]]|
|Renal USS|Possible malignancy/obstruction|Can identify renal cancer, stones etc.|
|Cystoscopy|^^|Camera inserted into urethra/bladder <br> eeded if possible [[Bladder cancer]] <br> <br>Used after renal USS or CT, as those are non-invasive|
|CT abdomen|^^|Used if cause cannot be identified, to find any possible masses|

**Possible types of casts:**

| Type of cast          | Association                                        |

# Management
## Overall management:
Overall management involves a combinations of [[#Investigations]] and [[#Examination findings]]:
1. Urine dipstick
	1. Identify heme: Check if [[Hematuria]] is present
	2. Identify protein. Helps differentiate [[#Glomerular bleeding]] (present) and [[#Non-glomerular bleeding]] (not-present)
	3. Identify bilirubin: Consider hemolysis, bilary disease or other disease that increase bilirubin
2. Urine microscopy
	1. Identifies RBC and WBCs
	2. Dysmorphic RBCs: [[#Glomerular bleeding]]
	3. RBC casts: [[#Glomerular bleeding]]
	4. Normal RBC: [[#Non-glomerular bleeding]]
	5. No RBC: Consider [[Rhabdomyolysis]], even with positive dipstick
3. Exam:
	1. Dysuria, indicative of [[Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)]]. Possible other UTI symptoms
	2. Flank pain, indicative of [[Pyelonephritis]]
	3. Both suggest infection as cause of hematuria
4. Other tests:
	1. Renal USS: Check for stones, renal cancer ^msxk1z
	2. Cystoscopy: **Must** be done if possible [[Bladder cancer]], and after [[Hematuria#^msxk1z|Renal USS]]
	3. CT abdomen

## Gross hematuria management
Management steps include:
1. Assess the timeframe of [[#Gross hematuria]], which can give you a sign of the cause
	1. **Initial**: Beginning part of urination
		1. Suggests urethra injury (trauma, [[Urethritis]])
		2. Could be due to foley cathether insertion, when removed trauma can cause initial gross hematuria
	2. **Terminal**: Ending of urination
		1. Suggests bladder or prostate issue
		2. [[Cystitis]]
		3. [[Bladder stones]] or [[Bladder cancer]]
		4. [[Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)]]
	3. **Throughout voiding**
		1. Suggests ureter or kidneys issue
		2. [[Pyelonephritis]]
		3. [[Nephrolithiasis]]
		4. Upper urinary cancers
