# Information
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a... 
Specifically the Oliguric or Anuric kind of ARF
	2. Usually asymptomatic, find through blood
	3. Diagnosis, needs any one of this:
		1. Increase Cr of 0.3 over 48hr
		2. Increase 1.5x baseline within 7 days
		3. Oliguria: Which is urine ouput <0.5 ml/kg/hr
	4. Diagnosis:
		1. Both creatinine and Urea rise
		2. But urea is reabsorbed if low water
		3. If kidney under-perfused, Urea rises more
	5. Three main categories:
		1. Pre-renal
			1. [[Sepsis (and SIRS)]], [[Heart Failure]], Volume depletion
			2. Bleeding, anaphylaxis (hypotension)
			3. Diuretics, burns (hypovolemia)
			4. Renal artery stenosis
			5. NSAID (afferent arteriolar vasoconstrict)
			6. ACE inhibitor (Efferent arteriolar vasodilation)
			7. Cr rises
			8. Urea rises higher, as absorbed with water
			9. So Urea/Cr ratio rises
			10. Increased sodium in blood, less sodium in urine, increased urine concentration. Not present in Intrinsic Renal
				1. Check this with urinalysis
			11. Treatment involves fluid admin and management of cause
		2. Post-renal
			1. Obstruction of urine, but needs bilateral
			2. High pressure in tubules so kidney cannot filter blood
			3. Anuria with post renal
			4. Test of choice: USS of bladder and kidney
			5. Treatment is IDC
			6. [[Nephrolithiasis]], [[Benign Prostate Hypertrophy (BPH)]], tumors
		3. Intrinsic renal
			1. [[Acute Tubular Necrosis]]
			2. [[Glomerulonephritis]]
			3. Toxins, such as contrast dyes, NSAIDs
			4. Normal Bun/Cr ratio
			5. Urine osm normal, as kidney failed so cannot absorb
			6. Sodium in urine high, as kidney cannot reabsorb sodium
			7. Casts, WBC, protein, and RBC and abnormal sediemnt in urine
		4. Summary of diagnosis
			1. Pre-renal, check Urea, Urea/Cr, check sodium in blood, urine, and urine conc
			2. Post-renal, USS
			3. Intrinsic:  check Urea, urea/cr, check sodium in blood, urine, urine conc, and sediment (casts, blood cells, protein)
			4. ![[Pasted image 20230520202605.png]]
		5. Summary of management:
			1. Pre and Post: manage cause and dialysis indications. Stop/hold drugs with renal function: Diuretics, ACEi, ARB, NSAID, Metformin (due to risk of lactic acidosis)
			2. Monitoring: Urea/Cr, daily weight (suggest retention of fluid), fluid chart, BP, electrolytes (as hyperkalemia is indication for dialysis)
