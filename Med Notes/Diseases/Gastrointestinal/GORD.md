GORD is reflux of gastric contents from stomach to esophagus, due to *failure* of the **lower esophageal sphincter**.
This causes irritation of esophageal mucosa.

It is a **clinical diagnosis** based on symptoms. However, an endoscopy is done in [[#Alarming symptoms]] symptoms as it can indicate [[Esophageal Cancer]]. See [[#Investigations]]

# Management
## Overall management:
Management depends on severity:
1. Mild GERD
	1. <2 episodes per week, mild symptoms
	2. Lifestyle changes + antacid and alginate or magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide
2. Moderate GERD
	3. If mild GERD, but not responsive to antacid or magnesium hydroxide
3. Severe GERD
	1. \2> episodes per week, or severe symptoms
	2. Esophagitis on endoscopy
	3. Daily PPI therapy
	4. Can incrase to PPI therapy BID if needed

4. Non-pharmacological treatments: **First line treatment**
	1. Weight loss
	2. Smoking cessation
	3. Dietary modification (avoid triggers)
		1. Fatty foods
		2. Caffeiene
		3. Chocolate
		4. Spicy foods
		5. Carbonated beverages
		6. Peppermint
5. Pharmacological treatments:
	1. Antacid+Alginate
	2. Magnesium Hydroxide
	3. Histamine (H2) blockers
		1. Famotidine, Ranitidine
		2. Block istamine receptors in parietal cells, leads to less acid production
	4. Proton-pump Inhibitors
		1. Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, Lensoprazole
		2. Inhibit H+ pump in parietal cells
