# Information
Diarrhea is the symptom of loose, watery stools that occur more frequently than usual, and has a long list of causes. Causes are differentiated based on:
1. Duration of symptoms
	1. Acute
	2. Persistent
	3. Chronic

| Type       | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Acute      | \> 3 loose bowel movements per day for <14 days   |
| Persistent | \> 3 loose bowel movements per day for 14-30 days |
|Chornic| \> 3 loose bowel movements per day for >4 weeks                                                  |

## Acute Diarrhea:
**Most common** form of diarrhea. Cases are mostly **viral** and **self-limited**
The most common *bacterial* causes of acute diarrhea are:
1. Salmonella
2. Campylobacter
3. Shigella

The most common *parasitic* causes of acute diarrhea are:
1. Giardia
2. Cryptosporidium
3. Entameba histolytica

## Chronic Diarrhea
Chronic diarrhea has two major subtypes that cause watery diarrhea. You can calculate the *osmotic gap*, which helps identify the cause:
1. Osmotic diarrhea: >50
2. Secretory diarrhea <50
$$Gap=290-(2[Na]]+2[K])_{stool} $$
Differences include:
| Info        | Osmotic diarrhea                                | Secretory diarrhea               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Mechanism   | Osmotic substance draws out fluid<br><br>Always due to ingestion of osmole               | Epithelial cells secrete fluid   |
| Stools      | Low volume watery stools                        | Large volume watery stools       |
| Fasting     | Improves during fasting                         | Persits during fasting and sleep |
| Osmotic gap | High stool gap                                  | Low stool gap                    |
| Cause       | Osmoles:<br>- Lactose intolerance<br>- Sorbitol<br>- Latulose | - Cholera<br>- VIPomas<br>- Bile acid malabsorption                                 |

- Stool culture not needed in [[#Acute Diarrhea:]] unless for high-risk patients. See [[#Investigations]] or [[#Overall management]]

# Management
## Overall management
Management depends on whether the diarrhea is **acute, persistent or chronic**
1. Acute: Normally viral, supportive treatment. Only testing and antibiotics if severe. See [[#Acute diarrhea management]]

## Acute diarrhea management
Given most cases are viral infections and self limited (See [[#Acute Diarrhea:]]), treatment is usually supportive
No stool testing or antibiotics, unless:
1. Severe illness (hypovolemia, severe abdominal pain) ^d19a71
2. Blood or mucous in stool
3. Fever over 38 degrees
4. High-risk patient (immunocompromised)

Acute antibiotics *can* be given in severe disease (See [[#^d19a71|Severe acute diarrhea]]):
1. Azithromycin
2. CIprofloxacin
3. Levofloxacin

Supportive treatent includes:
1. Provide fluid
2. Anti-diarrheal agents, such as [[Lopiramide]]
