# Information
Hiatal Hernias is a stomach herniation into a thorax, through the oesophageal hiatus (opening of diaphragm). This can be **asymptomatic**, or lead into [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)]] 
![[Pasted image 20230517225712.png]]

It is often an **incidental** finding
It has two main types:
1. [[#Type I hernia]]
2. [[#Type II hernia]]

### Type I hernia
Also called a **sliding hiatal hernia**. It occrs 95% of [[Hiatal Hernias]], due to displacement of GE junction above diaphragm:
- Stomach in usual alginment
- Fundus remains below GE junction
- "Hourglass" appearance
- Herniation through hiatus

Often asymptomatic, can lead to [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)]]

### Type II/III/IV hernia
Also called a **paraesophageal** hernia. It can cause epigastric pain, nausea, or retching. GERD symptoms less comon
- GE junction in normal location
- Protrusion of stomach fundus
- Defect in the "phrenoesophageal membrane"
- Classic finding: **Bowel sonds in lung fields**

It often occurs **after surgery**:
- GERD surgery
- Esophagomyotomy ([[Achalasia]] treatment)
- Partial gastectomy ([[Gastric cancer]])


> [!Important]+ Summary
- Bowel sounds with lung auscultation indicative of [[#Type II/III/IV hernia]]

# Management
## Type I Hernia:
**Treatment** is the same as [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)#Overall management:|GORD]]
Only use **surgery** if [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)#^f89517|Refractory GORD]]
