# Information
GORD is reflux of gastric contents from stomach to esophagus, due to *failure* of the **lower esophageal sphincter**.
This causes irritation of esophageal mucosa.

It is a **clinical diagnosis** based on symptoms. However, an endoscopy is done in [[#Alarming symptoms]] symptoms as it can indicate [[Esophageal Cancer]]. See [[#Investigations]]
![[Pasted image 20230517213830.png]]

It **can** occur in pediatric population, especially those with immature lower esophageal symptoms.
This leads to:
- Vomiting
- Crying

It can often lead to **refractory GORD**.

### Refratory GORD:
Refractory GORD presents with symptoms after treatment. Causes include: ^f89517
- Poor compiance with medical therapy after treatment
- **Functional heartburn** ^r8xz7z
	- When patient has symptoms, but has normal esophageal pH/manometry testing
	- Associated with anxiety and [[Depression]]
	- Sometimes treated with psychiatric medications
- **Non-acid reflux** ^77sdt5
	- Reflux after meals, but not acidic pH on testing
	- Indicates acid suppression has been achieved
	- Treated with **baclofen** (muscle relaxant)
	- Reduces transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation
- **Delayed gastric emptying ^psj8aa
	- Food stays in stomach long periods of time, makes GORD more likely
	- Diagnosed by gastric emptying studies
	- Patient consumes Technicium (99m)Tc egg or egg substitute, check how long it takes to move through stomach
	- Treatment: metoclopramide
- **Residual acid reflux**: ^29do3v
	- Rare in patients on twice daily PPI
	- Can add nighttime H2 blocker
	- Surgery or endoscopy treatment often indicated

# History
### Symptoms
#### Classic symptoms:
1. Heartburn
	1. Chest pain
	2. Retrosternal "burning" sensation
	3. Occurs after meals
	4. Often when lying flat
2. Regurgitation
3. Dyspepsia

#### Alarming symptoms
1. Onset at age > 60
2. [[Gastrointestinal Bleeding]]
3. Iron-deficiency [[Microcytic Anaemia]]
4. Weight loss
	1. Sign of [[Esophageal Cancer]]
5. Dysphagia
	1. Can be sign of advanced GORD, leading to [[Esophageal Cancer]]
6. Persistent vomiting
7. Gastrointestinal cancer in 1st degree relative

#### Other symptoms:
1. Respiratory
	1. Reflux into respiratory tract
	2. [[Asthma]] (adult-onset)
	3. Wheezing
	4. Cough
	5. Dyspnea
2. Damged to eenamel of teeth
3. Dysphagia

### Risk factors:
**Bolded if high risk**
__1. Alcohol__
__2. Smoking__
__3. Obesity__
4. Fatty foods
5. Caffeine
6. Chocolate
7. Peppermint
8. Hiatal hernia
9. Diabetes
	1. Causes gastropoeresis, so likely to cause [[#^psj8aa|Delayed gastric emptying]]  ^ffd52a

# Management
## Overall management:
Management depends on severity, **and** if refractory:
1. Mild GERD
	1. <2 episodes per week, mild symptoms
	2. Lifestyle changes + antacid and alginate or magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide
2. Moderate GERD
	3. If mild GERD, but not responsive to antacid or magnesium hydroxide
3. Severe GERD
	1. \2> episodes per week, or severe symptoms
	2. Esophagitis on endoscopy
	3. Daily PPI therapy
	4. Can incrase to PPI therapy BID if needed
4. Refractory GORD:
	1. [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)#^77sdt5|Non-acid reflux]]:
		1. Treat with [[baclofen]] (muscle relaxant)
		2. Reduces transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations
	2. [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)#^r8xz7z|Functional reflux]]:
		1. Treat with antipsychiatric medications for anxiety and depression
	3. [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)#^psj8aa|Delayed gastric emptying]]:
		1. Metoclopramide
	2. [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)#^29do3v|Residual acid reflux]]:
		3. Add nighttime H2 blocker
		4. Surgery (such as [[#^1e379e|Fundoplication]] or endoscopic treatment often indicated

**Treatment options:**
1. Non-pharmacological treatments: **First line treatment**
	1. Weight loss
	2. Smoking cessation
	3. Dietary modification (avoid triggers)
		1. Fatty foods
		2. Caffeiene
		3. Chocolate
		4. Spicy foods
		5. Carbonated beverages
		6. Peppermint
2. Pharmacological treatments:
	1. Antacid+Alginate
	2. Magnesium Hydroxide
	3. Histamine (H2) blockers
		1. Famotidine, Ranitidine
		2. Block istamine receptors in parietal cells, leads to less acid production
	4. Proton-pump Inhibitors
		1. Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, Lensoprazole
		2. Inhibit H+ pump in parietal cells
	5. Baclofen (muscle relaxant)
		1. Reduces transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations
	6. Metoclopramide
		1. Pro-kinetic, helps movement
3. Advanced options:
	1. Fundoplication: ^1e379e
		1. Stomach is wrapped arond LES
		2. ![[Pasted image 20230517225600.png]]
		3. Can be done via surgery or endoscopically

# Complications
1. **Erosive esophagitis ^72cac3
	1. Erosions and ulcerations of esophaeal mucosa
	2. Causes worsening/persistent [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)]] symptoms, due to inflammation of esophagitis.
	3. Has same treatment
	4. Can lead to [[Esophageal Cancer#Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Squamous Cell Esophageal Carcinoma]]
2. **Strictures** ^umqfec
	1. Fibrous narrowin of esophageal lumen
	2. Caused by healing of [[Esophagitis]]
	3. Causes solid food dysphagia or food impaction
	4. Treatment: Endoscopic diliatation, similar to [[Esophageal webs]]
