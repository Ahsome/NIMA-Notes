# Information
Esophageal Cancer is **cancer** of the esopagus. It has two main forms:
1. [[#Adenocarcinoma]]
2. [[#Squamous cell carcinoma]]

[[#Adenocarcinoma]] has a pre-malignant lesion, caled [[#Barrett's Esophagus]]

Lymph node metastasis depends on location of cancer:
- Upper esophagus (neck)
	- Cervical nodes
- Middle esophagus (chest)
	- Mediastinal nodes
	- Tracheobronchial nodes
- Lower (abdomen):
	- Celiac nodes
	- Gastric nodes

### Adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinoma requires metaplasia from [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)]]
It occurs in lower esophagus near stomach
It has risk factors similar to [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)]]

### Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma occurs in the mid esophagus.
- It occurs due to foods triggering irritation
- It also occurs due to diseases that prevent outflow of food, prolonging iritation
	- [[Achalasia]]
	- [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)#^umqfec\|Strictures]]


### Barrett's Esophagus
It is **metaplasia** of esophagus, from *squamous epithelium* to *intestinal epithelium* caused due to long-standing [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)]] and chronic inflammation.
It increases risk of [[#Adenocarcinoma]]

Identifcation means risk of [[#Adenocarcinoma]] is increased 0.1% to 0.4% per year

> [!Important]+ Summary
- [[#Barrett's Esophagus]] increases risk of [[#Adenocarcinoma]], ***not*** [[#Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]

# Management
## Barrett's management:
Treatment involves:
1. Continue treatment for [[Gastro-oesophagus Reflux Disease (GORD)]]
2. Possible surveillance endoscopy
	1. Depends on extent of Barrett's
	2. Depends on patient preference
