# Management
## Treatment of eosophageal varices
1. Urgent upper endoscopy to control bleeding
2. Variceal ligation for large veins
3. Non-selective beta-blockers
	- Nadolol and propanolol
	- Leads to unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction
	- Decreases portal inflow --> decreased portal pressures
