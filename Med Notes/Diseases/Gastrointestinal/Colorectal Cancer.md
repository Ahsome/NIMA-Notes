# Information
Colorectal Cancer is the 3rd most common cancer and is very deadly. It


***Types of polyps:***
- Most are benign
- Pedunculated - attacked via a stalk
- Sessile - broad based attached to colon
- Adenomatous polyps are most common type:
	- Tubular (80%)
	- Villous (often sessile) - "Villous is villain"
		- Higher grade of dysplasia
		- Size >10mm increases risk
	- Tubulovillous  
- Adenoma-Carcinoma sequence:
	- More ccommon in left-sided colon, sigmoid, rectum
	- Involves APC, KRAS, and p53 genes
	- Familial adenomatous polyposis (AD) - always progress to colon cancer
		- Colectomy or proctocolectomy 
		- coloscopy every year beginning from age 10-12
- Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer / Lynch Syndrome
	- Leads to colon cancer via microsatellite instability (80% risk)
	- Also increased risk of endometrial cancer
	- Colonoscopy every 1-2 years beginning from age 20-25 


> [!Important] Colonoscopy = standard screening test
> - Requires bowel prep and sedation
> - Every 10 years starting age 50
> - Patients with first-degree relative Hx of colon cancer:
> 	- Start screening at age 40, and repeat every 3-5 years

# History
### Symptoms
 - Occurs anywhere in colon
- Asymtpomatic and detected by screening (colonoscopy + biopsy)
- Unintentional weight loss, fevers, night sweats, loss in appetite
- PR bleeding (haematochezia)
- Abdominal pain
- Anaemia
- Metastasis - early satiety, abdominal distention, RUQ tenderness (liver mets), LHS supracvlavicular lymphadenopathy

| Right-sided (proximal/ascending) |Left-sided (distal/descending)|
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Iron-deficiency anaemia          | Haematochezia                         |
| Weight loss                      | Blood-streaked stool                  |
|                                  |Change in stool "caliber" - narrower and liquid|                                 |                                       |

### Risk factors:
- >50 years age
- FHx of colon cancer
- Adenomatous villous polyps
- FAP
- Lynch Syndrome

---

## Examination findings
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Night sweats
- Bloody stools 
- Adbominal distention
- RUQ tenderness (liver mets)
- Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy

## Investigations
| Key Tests                            | Result                          | Explanation                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Colonoscopy + biopsy                 | High-grade dysplasia + invasion | Cancer VS benign polyp                                                               |
| CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)       | High                            | Not for diagnpsis purposes, but used every year to track disease burden and progress |
| Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)    | High                            | Performed annually                                                                   |
| Fecal immunohistochemical test (FIT) | Haemoglobin and DNA high        | Performed annually                                                                   |
| Barium enema Xray                    | Visualise obstruction                                |                                                                                      |

*Other investigations:*
| Additional Tests       | Result                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | Visualises descending colon only |
| CT colonography        |Bowel prep required, but less invasive than a colonoscopy|

# Management
## Treatment
-  Treatment for localised disease: **==partial colectomy==**
	- ==With regional lymphadenectomy==
	- Removal of mesenteric lymph nodes
	- Adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive disease
- Metastatic disease (mostly to liver ): palliative chemotherapy
	- Some patients with limited mets receive surgery
- After remission: annual CT, colonoscopy and CEA level (carcinoembryonic antigen)
	- Note: CEA level is not used for diagnosis purposes, but rather for disease burden and prognosis 

---

# Complications
1. Bacteraemia and sepsis
	- Strep Bovis - normal colonic bacteria but can cause bacteraemia in colon cancer
	- Clostridium septicum - causes gangrene / myonecrosis
