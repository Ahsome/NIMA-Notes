# Information
Toxic Megacolon is a non-obstructive colonic dilation that stops colonic contractions. It is a rare complication of [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)#Diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis:|Ulcerative Colitis]] and [[Infectious Colitis]]

It occurs due to nitrix oxide inhibiting smooth muscle tone, leading to intestital dilation and **rapid distension**

The thinning of the walls can lead to perforation
