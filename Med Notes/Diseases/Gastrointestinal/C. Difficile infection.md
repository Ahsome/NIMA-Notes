# Information
C. Difficile infection is an infection caused by *Clostridioides difficile*. It is a ubiquitious spore, that is *not harmful with normal GI flora*. However, **antibiotics** can alter normal gut flora and allow C. diff growth

Infection is *not* due to invasion into the blood stream, but due to **toxin production:**
1. Toxin A: Enterotoxin
	1. Causes watery diarrhea
2. Toxin B: Cytotoxin
	1. Causes cell necrosis and fibrin deposition

> [!Important]
- Not possible with normal GI flora, only after antibiotics

--- 
# History
### Symptoms
1. Massive watery diarrhea (>3 per day)
2. Abdominal pain and cramping
3. Fever and leukocytosis

### Risk factors:
1. Recent antibiotic use. Commonly: 
	1. Clindamycin
	2. FLuoroquinolones
	3. Broad spectrum penicillin/cephalosoporin
2. CHronic PPI
	1. Loss of protection from H+

### Questions to ask
>*"Any recent antibiotic use?"*
>*"Do you consistently use PPI?"*

|Colonoscopy |Pseudomembranous colitis|Rarely done|
|WBC|<15k (non-severe) <br> \>15k (severe)|Used to identify severity|

# Management
## Overall management:
Management involves initial diagnosis through stool samples of toxin A/B, as well as elimination of other [[Diarrhea]] causes

Treatments depends on severity:
| Test    | Non-severe | Severe    | Fulminant |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| WBC     | <15k       | >15k      |       |
| Cr      | <1.5 mg/dL | 1.5 mg/dL |       |
| Lactate |       |      |Increased |
| Others  |  |  |Hypotension <br>Shock <br>Ileus|
