# Information
Hemorrhoids are *dilated submucosal veins of anus*. They can cause:
1. Bleeding
2. Pain
3. Pruritis
4. Hard stools
5. Strain to defecation

There are two main categories, based on the **pectinate (dentate) line**. This is due to tissue above and below the line have *different embryological origins*:
1. [[#Internal hemorrhoids]]: Above dentate line. Sometimes, these can prolapse below the dentate line
3. [[#External hemorrhoids]]: Below dentate line

### Internal hemorrhoids
Internal hemorrhoids are hemorrhoids that start **above** the dentate line. They *can* prolapse to below the dentate line. They are much more common with patients with [[Portal Hypertension]], due to the fact they drain into the portal system via the superior rectal vein

In terms of [[Gastrointestinal Bleeding]]:
When they bleed, bleeding comes from the *internal (superior) hemorrhoidal plexus*:
- Plexus of veins supplied by branches of IMA
- Venous drainage to superior rectal vein --> Portal system
	- As such, [[#Internal hemorrhoids]] more common with patients with [[Portal Hypertension]]
- May swell in portal hypertension

It lacks visceral innervation. As such, it has **painless bleeding with bowel movements**

### External hemorrhoids
Internal hemorrhoids are hemorrhoids that start **below** the dentate line.

In terms of [[Gastrointestinal Bleeding]]:
When they bleed, bleeding comes from the *external (inferior) hemorrhoidal plexus*:
- Plex of veins supplied by branches of inrerior rectal aretry
- Venous drainage to inferior vena cava
- Unlikely to bleed
- Somatic innervation, leading to pruritis. 
- leading to pain. Severe pain when thrombosed
- Main problem is pruritis
