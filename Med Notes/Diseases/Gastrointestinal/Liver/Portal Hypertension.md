# Information
Portal Hypertension opens venous collaterals between the portal and systemic veins

### Varices 
- Tortuous veins --> may bleed

### Oesophageal varices 
- Upper GI bleeding

### Stomach (portal hypertensive gasgropathy) 
- Upper GI bleeding
- Friable gastric mucosa
- Ectatic blood vessels
- Causes upper GI bleeding - slow, chronic bleed 
- Diagnosis with an upper endoscope -- white, reticular pattern "snakeskin"

### Rectum 
- Internal haemorrhoids which may bleed (painless)

### Umbilicus - caput medusa

### Enlarged spleen (splenic vein) 
- Low platelets


# Management
## Treatment of eosophageal varices
1. Urgent upper endoscopy to control bleeding
2. Variceal ligation for large veins
3. Octeotride
	- Constricts splanchnic arterioles
	- Decreases portal flow
1. Non-selective beta-blockers
	- Nadolol and propanolol
	- Leads to unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction
	- Decreases portal inflow --> decreased portal pressures 


### General treatment of ascites and portal hypertension
1. Sodium restriction
	- Goal <2000mcg/day
2. Spironolactone (drug of choice) 50-100mg
	- Potassium-sparing diuretic
	- Most effective drug for ascites 
3. Large volume ascitic paracentesis 
4. Surgical: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
	- Creation of a channel in liver which bypasses the cirrhotic liver and treats portal HTN
