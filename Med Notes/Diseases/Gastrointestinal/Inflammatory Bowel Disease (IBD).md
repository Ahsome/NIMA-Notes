# Information
Inflammatory Bowel Disease is a chronic autoimmune bowel isease characteristed by 2 diseases:
1. Crohn's disease
2. Ulcerative colitis (UC)

Both have relapsing, remitting courses, where flares require medication therapy. And both have similar symtpoms (abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea).

## Diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis:
- Chronic diarrhoea for >4 weeks
- Evidence of chronic inflammation of colon on colonoscopy
- Exclusion of other diagnoses (stool culture, ova, parasites)

## Diagnosis of Crohn's Disease:
- Chronic absominal pain and/or diarrhoea
- Small bowel imaging (MRI/CT/barium x-ray) findings
- Colonoscopy with intubation of TI for biopsy
- Exclusion of other diagnoses (stool culture, ova, parasites)

# History
### Symptoms
- Abdominal pain - described as "crampy"
- Recurrent episodes
- Bloody diarrhoea

|Ulcerative Colitis| Crohn's Disease                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left lower quadrant pain (starts in rectum and moves upwards)                   | Entire wall "transmural" (VS mucosal/submucosal)                                  |
| Never involves small intestines ("colitis")                                     | "Mouth to anus" - oral ulcers                             |
|Bloody diarrhoea - frank blood|               Skip lesions + Cobblestone appearance      |
| Tenesmus (frequent feeling of needing to poop)                                  | Classically in terminal ileum - malabsorption of B12      |
|Pseudopolyps (healing of polyps) - Colonoscopy                                  | Right lower quadrant pain (TI)                            |

>[!Important] Rule out infection:
>-  C.difficile toxin
>- Stool cultures for campylobacter, yersinia, salmonella, shigella
>- Microscopy for ova and parasites
>- Giardia stool antigen

- Uveitis 
- Episcleritis

|FBC - elevated ESR and CRP, microcytic anaemia, but non-specific|FBC - may see macrocytic anaemia (B12 deficiency)|

# Management
## General Treatment
**Medications**
- Induction of remission - often with corticosteroids
- Maintenance of remission (anti-inflammatory)
	- Corticosteroids
	- Sulfasalazine or 5-ASA
	- Methotreate
	- Infliximab

**Surgery**
- Adenocarcinoma or fistulas or other complications

## UC Treatment and Management
Initial approach – aims to induce remission. Use both the following together.
1.  Mesalazine – rectal enema. This will only work in proctitis and left sided UC.
2.  5-ASA (aminosalicylic acid) – oral tablets
3.  Oral corticosteroid (hydrocortisone) – mild/moderate UC that is non- responsive to 5-ASA
4.  IV corticosteroid (hydrocortisone) – if acute severe UC, which is a medical emergency. See Montreal criteria.

Maintenance treatment – maintains remission once initial insult resolves. 
1. 5-ASA (oral)
2. Addition of immunomodulatory drug – azathioprine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate + folic acid
3. Infliximab (TNF-a inhib) – biologic drug that is effective in controlling chronically active disease

## Crohn's Treatment and Management
- Acute flare – prednisolone or hydrocortisone. IV vs oral depending on severity of CD
- Maintenance therapy: Immunomodulatory medication – azathioprine, mercaptopurine or methotrexate + folic acid  
- Biologics (if above don’t work) – infliximab, adalimumab

---

# Complications
1. Adenocarcinoma of the colon
	- Increased risk with UC - especially is >10yr duration and involvement of the right colon (more disease progression)
	- Colonoscopy repeated every 2-3 years
2. Smoking improved outcomes in UC, but worsens outcomes in Crohn's (modifiable)
3. [[Toxic Megacolon]]: Leads to severe, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and distension. See toxic megacolon
