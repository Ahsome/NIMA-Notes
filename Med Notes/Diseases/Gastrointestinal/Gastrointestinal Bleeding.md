# Information
Gastrointestinal Bleeding is bleeding that occurs in the GI tract. It has two main categories:
1. [[#Upper GI bleeding]], any bleeding above the Ligament of Treitz
2. [[#Lower GI bleeding]]

The Ligament of Treitz suspends the distal duodenum:

### Upper GI bleeding
Upper GI bleeding, also called hematemesis, is bleeding that is proximal to the Ligament of Treitz
- Often descried as coffee-ground emesis
- Due to blod exposed to stomach acid
- Can develop Melena: dark black ("tarry") stools. Main sign of upper GI bleeding
- Rarely hematochezia (only if brisk upper GI bleed without being changed to melena, normally [[#Lower GI bleeding]])

Common causes include:
- [[Peptic Ulcer Disease]]
- [[Erosive gastritis]]
- [[Erosive esophagitis]]
- [[Esophageal varices]] or [[Gastric varices]]
	- Normally due to [[Cirrhosis]]
- [[Portal hypertensive gastropathy]]
	- Normally due to [[Portal Hypertension]] fro [[Chronic Liver Disease]]

### Lower GI bleeding
Lower GI bleeding is described as "Bright red blood per rectum", or hematochezia

Common causes include:
- [[Diverticulosis]]
- [[Angiodysplasia]]
- Colitis, such as [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)#Diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis:|Ulcerative Colitis]], [[Ischemic Colitis]], [[Infectious Colitis]]
- Malignancy, such as [[Colon Cancer]]
- Anal bleeding (from [[Hemorrhoids]]/[[Fissures]])

# Management
## General management
Whether it be [[#Upper GI bleeding]] or [[#Lower GI bleeding]], there are general management principles to follow:
1. Insertion of two large-bore periperal (16-gauge) IVs
2. Administer IV fluids
	1. Many patients just from IV fluids become stable
3. If not helped by IV fluids, need to check criteria for blood transfusion
	1. Individualised to patient, differs across hospital
	2. Hgb < 8mg/dL  for young, low risk patients
	3. Hgb < 9mg/dL or older, comorbid patients
	4. Hgb < 7mg/dL for variceal bleeds
		1. Lower because due to portal hypertension, transfusion can further increase pressure
4. Platelet transfusion if platelets < 50k
5. FFP or prothrombin complex for coagulopathy

## Lower GI bleeding
1. While hematochezia normally [[#Lower GI bleeding]], there is a 10-15% risk of [[#Upper GI bleeding]]. As such, Nasogastric lavage is done
	1. Insert nasogastric tube
	2. Flush with fluid
	3. Pull fluid out, look for coffee-ground material, or bright red blood
	4. If present, then sign it is upper GI bleed
2. Once confirmed lower GI bleed, severity needs to be considered
3. If severe, life-threatening bleed: **Surgery** is required to identify source
4. If stabalised with fluids
