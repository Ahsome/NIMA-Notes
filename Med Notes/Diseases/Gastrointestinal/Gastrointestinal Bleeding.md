# Information
Gastrointestinal Bleeding is bleeding that occurs in the GI tract. It has two main categories:
1. [[#Upper GI bleeding]], any bleeding above the Ligament of Treitz
2. [[#Lower GI bleeding]]

The Ligament of Treitz suspends the distal duodenum:

### Upper GI bleeding
Upper GI bleeding, also called hematemesis, is bleeding that is proximal to the Ligament of Treitz
- Often descried as coffee-ground emesis
- Due to blod exposed to stomach acid
- Can develop Melena: dark black ("tarry") stools. Main sign of upper GI bleeding
- Rarely hematochezia (only if brisk upper GI bleed without being changed to melena, normally [[#Lower GI bleeding]])

Common causes include (Italic is most):
- *[[Peptic Ulcer Disease]]*
- *[[Erosive gastritis]]*
- *[[Erosive esophagitis]]*
- [[Esophageal Cancer]]
- [[Esophageal varices]] or [[Gastric varices]]
	- Normally due to [[Cirrhosis]]
- [[Portal hypertensive gastropathy]]
	- Normally due to [[Portal Hypertension]] fro [[Chronic Liver Disease]]
- [[Mallory-Weiss tear]]

### Lower GI bleeding
Lower GI bleeding is described as "Bright red blood per rectum", or hematochezia

Common causes include (Italic is most):
- *[[Diverticulosis]]*
- *[[Angiodysplasia]]*
- Colitis, such as [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)#Diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis:|Ulcerative Colitis]], [[Ischemic Colitis]], [[Infectious Colitis]]
- Malignancy, such as [[Colorectal Cancer]]
- Anal bleeding (from *[[Hemorrhoids]]/[[Anal Fissure]])*
	- Painless bleeding with bowel movements: [[Hemorrhoids#Internal hemorrhoids]]

# History
### Symptoms

Lower GI bleeding:
If suspected [[Hemorrhoids]]:
1. If painless bleeding with bowel movemenets: [[Hemorrhoids#Internal hemorrhoids]]]

### Risk factors:
Lower GI risk factors:
1. Cirhossis. Think [[Esophageal varices]] and [[Gastric varices]]
2. Alcohol. Think [[Mallory-Weiss tear]], and [[Cirrhosis]]
3. NSAIDs: Think [[Peptic Ulcer Disease]]
4. H Pylori. Think exacerbations of [[GORD]], leading to [[Erosive esophagitis]] and [[Esophageal Cancer]]

# Management
## General management
Whether it be [[#Upper GI bleeding]] or [[#Lower GI bleeding]], there are general management principles to follow:
1. Insertion of two large-bore periperal (16-gauge) IVs
2. Administer IV fluids
	1. Many patients just from IV fluids become stable
3. If not helped by IV fluids, need to check criteria for blood transfusion
	1. Individualised to patient, differs across hospital
	2. Hgb < 8mg/dL  for young, low risk patients
	3. Hgb < 9mg/dL or older, comorbid patients
	4. Hgb < 7mg/dL for variceal bleeds
		1. Lower because due to portal hypertension, transfusion can further increase pressure
4. Platelet transfusion if platelets < 50k
5. FFP or prothrombin complex for coagulopathy

## Lower GI bleeding management
**Important**: With [[#Lower GI bleeding]], there is ***no real role*** for medical management; there are no drugs administered to try stop the bleeding or limit the bleeding
- Contrast with [[#Upper GI bleeding]], where there are options. See [[#Upper GI bleeding management]]

**Management** involves:
1. While hematochezia normally [[#Lower GI bleeding]], there is a 10-15% risk of [[#Upper GI bleeding]]. As such, Nasogastric lavage is done
	1. Insert nasogastric tube
	2. Flush with fluid
	3. Pull fluid out, look for coffee-ground material, or bright red blood
	4. If present, then sign it is upper GI bleed
2. Once confirmed lower GI bleed, severity needs to be considered
3. If severe, life-threatening bleed: **Surgery** is required to identify source
	1. If **brisk GI bleeds**, one treatment is **Angiography** ^ifgka2
		1. Dye is injected into mesenteric vessels
		2. If brisk [[#Lower GI bleeding]], then dye is visible leaking into the mesenter
		3. ![[Pasted image 20230516232953.png|150]]
		4. Only useful if blood loss is 0.5 to 1.0mL/minute
		5. No bowel prep needed
		6. Allows intervention to stop bleeding
			1. Once vessel is identified, you can add intra-arterial vasopression or embolisation to close bleeding
4. If stabalised with fluids, refer to **colonoscopy**
	1. Can identify bleeds in the colon, like [[Angiodysplasia]] or [[Colon Cancer]]
	2. Can treat bleeding endoscopically
	3. **Best done** after *bowel prep*, so mostly done in stable patients
	4. If colonoscopy is negative but blood is lost:
		1. Radionuclide imaging
			1. Most sensitive test for ongoing bleeding
			2. 99mTc (Technicium) pertechnetate-labeled red cells
			3. Detects bleeds 0.1 to 0.5mL/min in dark area
			4. ![[Pasted image 20230516233042.png|150]]
		2. CT angiography
			1. Detects bleeds 0.3 to 05 mL/min

## Upper GI bleeding management
It is **important** to note: There is ***a real role*** for medical management; unlike [[#Lower GI bleeding]]

Medical management:
1. **IV PPI**
	1. Given to all upper GI bleeds
	2. When done, stomach acid is reduced, it can allow the mucosa to heal and stop bleeding
2. **Octreotide**
	1. Used *only for variceal bleeds*
	2. Constricts splanchnic arterioles
	3. Decreases portal flow
	4. Limit bleed from varices
3. **Antibiotics**
	1. Used *only for variceal bleeds* with *[[Cirrhosis]]*
	2. Given as up to 20% develop infections, often spontaneous bacterial [[Peritonitis]]
	3. Also shown to ⬇️ bleeding

Main stay management:
1. **Upper endoscopy**:
	1. Needed urgently for ongoing bleeds
	2. Can treat bleeding endoscopically
	3. In stable patients, may be done non-urgently, similar to [[#Lower GI bleeding management]]
2. Other tests:
	1. Angiography. Can be used to identify source similar to [[Gastrointestinal Bleeding#^ifgka2|Lower GI bleeding]]. However, often not needed as upper endoscopy is normally enough to diagnose and treat cause
	2. Capsule endoscopy
	3. Deep small bowel enteroscopy ("push")
