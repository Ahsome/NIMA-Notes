# Information
Osteoarhritis is a degeneration of the synovial joints, leading to monoarticular *or* polyarticular disease. Major features include:
 1. *Breakdown of hyaline cartilage*: Hyline cartilage surrounds the joint spaces, and provides smooth surface for gliding bones ^f0e007
 2. *Hypertrophy of bone*: Causes **bone sclerosis** of subchondral bone, and **bone spurs**/osteophytes may form. This *narrows* the joint space, leading to bone-on-bone ^ac6961
 3. *Minimal inflammation of synovial fluid*: This is a non-inflammatory arthritis ^1b4f19

While it can affect any joint, the *weight-bearing joints* are **most commo**n:

| 1. Hips<br>2. Knees<br>3. Cervical spine<br>4. Lumber | ![[Pasted image 20230512011932.png\|150]] |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

It is a **clinical diagnosis**. [[#Investigations]] are supportive evidence.

> [!Important]
- Three major features include [[#^f0e007|Breakdown of hyaline cartilage]], [[#^ac6961|Hypertrophy of bone]] and [[#^1b4f19|Minimal inflammation of synovial fluid]]
- Most commonly affects weight-bearing joints
- It is a **clinical diagnosis**. [[#Investigations]] are supportive evidence.

# History
### Symptoms
| Features                     | Explanation                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insidous onset of joint pain | Bone pain fibers irritated by movement<br>Deep, dull ache<br>Worsened by activity, improved by rest |
| Stiffness                    | In morning or after inactivity, last <30 minutes                                                    |
| Restricted ROM               | Boney enlargement limits movement                                                                                                    |

### Risk factors:
| Risk factor  | Explanation                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Advanced age | 80% over 55yo                                               |
| Obseity      | Modifiable risk factor. Commonly:<br>- Knees<br>- Hip |
| Trauma       | Either major trauma to joint or repeated microtrauma                                                            |


### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any pain that's worse when you are active, but imrpvoed when you rest"*
>"*Do you notice any stiffness when you wake up?*"
>"*How logn to symptoms last? Less than 30 miutes?*"
