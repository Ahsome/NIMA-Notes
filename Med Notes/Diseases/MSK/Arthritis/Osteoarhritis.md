# Information
Osteoarhritis is a degeneration of the synovial joints, leading to monoarticular *or* polyarticular disease. Major features include:
 1. *Breakdown of hyaline cartilage*: Hyline cartilage surrounds the joint spaces, and provides smooth surface for gliding bones ^f0e007
 2. *Hypertrophy of bone*: Causes **bone sclerosis** of subchondral bone, and **bone spurs**/osteophytes may form. This *narrows* the joint space, leading to bone-on-bone ^ac6961
 3. *Minimal inflammation of synovial fluid*: This is a non-inflammatory arthritis ^1b4f19

While it can affect any joint, the *weight-bearing joints* are **most commo**n:
