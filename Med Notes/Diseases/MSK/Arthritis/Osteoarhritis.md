# Information
Osteoarhritis is a degeneration of the synovial joints, leading to monoarticular *or* polyarticular disease. Major features include:
 1. *Breakdown of hyaline cartilage*: Hyline cartilage surrounds the joint spaces, and provides smooth surface for gliding bones ^f0e007
 2. *Hypertrophy of bone*: Causes **bone sclerosis** of subchondral bone, and **bone spurs**/osteophytes may form. This *narrows* the joint space, leading to bone-on-bone ^ac6961
 3. *Minimal inflammation of synovial fluid*: This is a non-inflammatory arthritis ^1b4f19

While it can affect any joint, the *weight-bearing joints* are **most commo**n:

| 1. [[#Hip involvement:\|Hips]]<br>2. [[#Knee involvement:\|Knees]]<br>3. [[#Hand involvement:\|Hands]]<br>4. Cervical spine<br>5. Lumber | ![[Pasted image 20230512011932.png\|150]] |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

It is a **clinical diagnosis**. [[#Investigations]] are supportive evidence.

## Knee involvement:
When knees are involve, it often involves **both knees**. This contrasts with [[#Hip involvement:]], which often is unilateral. More weight bearing on medial side, so asymmetric narrowing of medial side occurs.

![[Pasted image 20230512013338.png|150]]

## Hip involvement:
Hip involvement is normally unilateral, which contrasts with [[#Knee involvement:]] which is bilateral. It results in **groin, buttock, or thigh pain**. There is reduced range of motion, and crepitus may be present.

## Hand involvement:
Hip involvement commonly affects:
1. Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Contrast with [[Med Notes/Diseases/MSK/Arthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis|Rheumatoid Arthritis]], where DIP joints are spared
2. Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints
3. 1st. Carpometacarpal (CMC) joint

It does ***not involve the MCP***, which is involved in [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]

## Nodal Osteoarthritis
Nodal osteoarthritis is[[Med Notes/Diseases/MSK/Arthritis/Osteoarhritis|Osteoarhritis]] that affects the joints in the fingers and toes. Signs include boney overgrowth and osteophytes at specific sections of the hand. It is **most common** at the i*ndex* and *middle* fingers:
1. Heberden's nodes: Located in DIP
2. Bouchard's nodes: Located in PIP

Over time, inflammatory signs subside and joints become less painful, but swellings remains

> [!Important]
- Three major features include [[#^f0e007|Breakdown of hyaline cartilage]], [[#^ac6961|Hypertrophy of bone]] and [[#^1b4f19|Minimal inflammation of synovial fluid]]
- Most commonly affects weight-bearing joints
- It is a **clinical diagnosis**. [[#Investigations]] are supportive evidence.
- First line management is **weight loss and exercise**. Only use [[NSAID|NSAIDS]] if not responding. See [[#Management]]

# Management
## Long-term management:
First line of management include:
1. **Weight loss**
2. **Exercise and physical therapy**: Used to maintain motion and strength
3. Use of **assisted devices** to move around
4. Education of disease of conditions and self-treatment
5. Reduction of comorbidities such as obesity

If first line is not affective, *Topical* or *Oral* [[NSAID|NSAIDS]] can be given, as well as injections and [[Opiods]]. See [[#Pharmacological treatment:]]

Lastly, surgery is possible, with 30% of [[#Knee involvement:]] eventually requiring surgery. This is likely higher in [[#Hip involvement:]]. There is inconclusive evidence of the use with [[#Hand involvement:]]

### Pharmacological treatment:
First line drugs should be used *as necessary*, but can have *regular dosing* if pain persists:

| Drug          | Application                     | Explanation                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topical NSAID | Topical on site, up to 4x daily | First-line. Has benefit for pain, and limited absorption compared to oral NSAID                   |
| Capsacin      | Topical on site, 0.025%         | Some evidence of pain benefit, can cause burning                                                  |
| Oral NSAID     | Oral                            | Stronger pain relief than Topical NSAID or Paracetamol, but more systemic side effects and issues.<br><br>Can be first-line, but only with patients with low NSAID risk<br>Can be used in conjunction with [[Duloxitene]], see [[#^cad992\|Additional treatment]] |
| Paracetamol   | Oral                            | Pain relief, weaker than Oral NSAID but less complications                                                                                                  |

Beyond this, additional treatment is possible:

| Drug                      | Application                                | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                           |         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Intra-articular injection | Injection, Corticosteroid                  | Can provide relief 4-16 weeks. Studies show more help in [[#Knee involvement:]] than [[#Hip involvement:]]<br><br>Potential benefit if used before major travel or important occasion |         |
| ^^                        | Injection, Hyaluronan                      | Inconsistend benefit, many biased studies, sometimes worsening symptoms. Last longer than corticosteroid injections                                                                   |         |
| ^^                        | Injection, Platelet-rich Plasma/Stem Cells | Favourble benefit in recent studies but highly biased studies                                                                                                                         |         |
| [[Duloxitene]]            | Oral                                       | Reduces pain and improves function, similar to Oral NSAID. Can be used in conjunction with Oral NSAID                                                                                 | ^cad992 |
| Opiods                    | Varies                                     | Very limited role due to modest if any benefit, and significant harm<br><br>Studies show [[Tapentadol]] safer than [[Oxycodone]] after 1 year, but long-term safety is not known                                                                                                                                                                                      |         |

>[!Important]
>Only use oral NSAID first line in patients with low NSAID risk
