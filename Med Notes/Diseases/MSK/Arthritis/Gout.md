# Information
Gout is a joint disorder where **Monosodium urate** is deposited in joints, most commonly the **base of great toe (podagra)**. They come from uric acid in the blood binding to sodium, forming crystals. This triggers an **inflammatorary response**, and causes *acute recurrent attacks of arthritis*

It depends on the following the following (See [[#Risk factors:]]):
1. Hyperuricemia
2. Genetics
3. Cool temperatures

When risk factors are met, a *trigger* is needed to start the attack. See [[#^9ecc5f|Triggers]]

After a flare, there is an *intercritical period* before the next attack. If kept chronically, it can result in a [[#Tophaceous gout:]], or urate collections in connective tissue

## Tophaceous gout:
It is urate crystals in *connective tissues*:
1. Present as slowly-enlarging hard masses
2. Usually *not-painful* or *tender*
3. Can cause erosion of surrouding bone

***Do not confuse with RA nodules*** [[#Tophaceous gout:]]. These come from longstanding hyperuricemia

> [!Important]
- It most commonly affects the [[Glossary#^d61e39|Podagra]] joint ^9e9d3e
- **Do not confuse** [[Med Notes/Diseases/MSK/Arthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis\|Rheumatoid Arthritis]] nodules as [[#Tophaceous gout:]]. These come from longstanding hyperuricemia
- Urate is mostly excreted via Kidneys and Urine. As such, reduction in GFR is a trigger for gout
- Not useful to measure uric acid levels for hyperuriemia for gout given most hyperuricemic patines never develop gout, they require a genetic disposition (See [[#Information]]) ^76ceac
- Allopurinol/Febuxostat can increase toxicity of chemo agents ([[Azathioprine]], [[6-MP]]) as they prevent their breakdown ^23da28

# History
### Symptoms
Symptoms come with **recurrent attacks**, are **acute** and usually **monoarthritic:
1. Severe joint pain
2. Redness
3. Swelling
4. Warmth

>[!Important]
>![[#^9e9d3e]]

### Risk factors:
1. Hyperuricemia
2. Genetics
	1. Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome: Ezyme (HGPRT) defect in purine salvage pathway
	2. Von Gierke's Disease: Glycogen Storage disease. Leads to multiple bouts of hypoglyemia, lactic acidosis, promotes urate reabsoprtion
3. Cool temperature
	1. Comes from most distal locations of the body, aids in precipitation of crystals
4. Obese males
5. Hypertension
6. Sudden alcohol drinking
7. Consumption of red meat/seafood
8. Myeloproliferative disorders

**Triggers:** ^9ecc5f
1. Increased serum uric acid levels production
	1. Excess purine nucleotides
		1. Purine nucleotides break down into uric acid
		2. Sources include red meat, seafood
		3. Trauma/surgery can break down purines
	2. Myeloprolfierative disorders:
		1. Cause increased cell turnover
		2. Include:
			1. CHronic myeloid leukemia
			2. Essential thrombocytosis
			3. Polycthemia vera
2. Decreased excretion by kidneys
	1. Reduction in GFR results in reduced uric acid excretion
	2. Includes:
		1. Renal failure
		2. Volume depletion
		3. Diuretics
			1. Decreases GFR
			2. Decreases uric acid secretion
			3. Especially [[Thiazide]], [[Loop diuretics]]
		4. Alcohol:
			1. Metabolises into lactic acid
			2. Lactic acid increases reabsoprtion of urate
3. Rare genetic enzyme defects


### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any redness or swelling in the joint?"*
>"*Do you notice that you get repeat attacks of this?*"

# Management
## Acute Treatment
Acute attacks require either:
1. Oral glucocorticoids:
	1. Usually prednisone/prednisolone
	2. Avoid in infection, post-op, brittle [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
2. NSAIDs
	1. Usually high-dose potent NSAIDS
	2. Includes [[Naproxen]], [[Indomethacin]]
	3. Avoid with high bleeding risk (e.g. anticoag use), [[Chronic Kidney Disease]], peptic ulcer disease
	4. Aspirin *not used* as high dose (1-2 grams/day) inhibit urate excretion
		1. Safe for low dose, so can keep for cardiac issues

Can also use:
1. [[Colchicine]]:
	1. Anti-inflammatory: Inhibits white blood cell activity
	2. Alternative to glucocorticoids or NSAIDs
2. Glucocorticoid intraarticular injection
	1. Used when flare invovles only one or two joints

## Prevention
Prevention focuses on two major methods:
1. Lifestyle:
	1. Weight loss and exercise reduce serum urate and risk of flares
	2. Moderation of:
		1. Red meat intake
		2. Seafood intake
		3. Alcohol intake
2. Pharacological use:
	1. Indicated for frequent attacks, tophi/structural damage, and renal insufficiency (CrCl <60mL/minute)

### Pharmacological use:

It is important to note that Xanthine oxidase inhibotrs prevent the metabolis of [[Azathioprine]] and [[6-MP]], important chemo drugs. As such, it may boost its effect and cause toxicity
