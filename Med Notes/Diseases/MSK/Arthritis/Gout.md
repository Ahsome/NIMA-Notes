# Information
Gout is a joint disorder where **Monosodium urate** is deposited in joints, most commonly the **base of great toe (podagra)**. They come from uric acid in the blood binding to sodium, forming crystals. This triggers an **inflammatorary response**, and causes *acute recurrent attacks of arthritis*

It depends on the following the following (See [[#Risk factors:]]):
1. Hyperuricemia
2. Genetics
3. Cool temperatures

When risk factors are met, a *trigger* is needed to start the attack. See [[#^9ecc5f|Triggers]]

After a flare, there is an *intercritical period* before the next attack. If kept chronically, it can result in a [[#Tophaceous gout:]], or urate collections in connective tissue

## Tophaceous gout:
It is urate crystals in *connective tissues*:
1. Present as slowly-enlarging hard masses
2. Usually *not-painful* or *tender*
3. Can cause erosion of surrouding bone

***Do not confuse with RA nodules*** [[#Tophaceous gout:]]. These come from longstanding hyperuricemia

> [!Important]
- It most commonly affects the [[Glossary#^d61e39|Podagra]] joint ^9e9d3e
- **Do not confuse** [[Med Notes/Diseases/MSK/Arthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis\|Rheumatoid Arthritis]] nodules as [[#Tophaceous gout:]]. These come from longstanding hyperuricemia
- Urate is mostly excreted via Kidneys and Urine. As such, reduction in GFR is a trigger for gout

# History
### Symptoms
Symptoms come with **recurrent attacks**, are **acute** and usually **monoarthritic:
1. Severe joint pain
2. Redness
3. Swelling
4. Warmth

>[!Important]
>![[#^9e9d3e]]

### Risk factors:
1. Hyperuricemia
2. Genetics
3. Cool temperature
	1. Comes from most distal locations of the body, aids in precipitation of crystals
4. Obese males
5. Hypertension

**Triggers:** ^9ecc5f
1. Increased serum uric acid levels production
	1. Excess purine nucleotides
		1. Purine nucleotides break down into uric acid
		2. Sources include red meat, seafood
		3. Trauma/surgery can break down purines
	2. Myeloprolfierative disorders:
		1. Cause increased cell turnover
		2. Include:
			1. CHronic myeloid leukemia
			2. Essential thrombocytosis
			3. Polycthemia vera
2. Decreased excretion by kidneys
	1. Reduction in GFR results in reduced uric acid excretion
	2. Includes:
		1. Renal failure
		2. Olume depletion
		3. Diuretics
			1. Decreases GFR
			2. Decreases
3. Rare genetic enzyme defects
