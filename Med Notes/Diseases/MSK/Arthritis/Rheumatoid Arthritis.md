# Information
Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune infammation of the synovium. The *synovium* is a thin layer of tissues that line joints and tendon sheaths, and secretes hyaluronic acid to lubricate the joint space. It results in a **systemic disease** with **extra-articular complications**. It may wax and wave with flares.

Symptoms are **symmetrical**, as autoimmune conditions affect both sides of the body. It has a gradual onset of symptoms, and commonly involves the **wrists** and the **hands**. It classicly affects:
1. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Contrast with [[Osteoarhritis]], where MCP joints are spared
2. Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints

It does ***not involve the DIP***, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]. It also *does not* involve the Lumbar spine, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]. Exception is C1-C2, see [[#Examination findings]].

If a patient has [[Osteoporosis]], it is ***accelerated by RA***:
1. Disease itself accelerates [[Osteoporosis]]
2. Steroid treatment for [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (See [[#Management]]) can worsen [[Osteoporosis]]
3. Leads to 30% increase in major fracture, 40% increase hip fracture

Diagnosis involves inflammatory arthritis of 3 or more joints, lasting *more than 6 weeks*

> [!Important]
- Palpable nodules are ***Pathognomonic*** for[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]. See [[#^7e02a2|Extra-articular features]] ^2d22d0
- Increases rate of [[Osteoporosis]]. See [[#^25f590|Complications > Osteoporosis]]
- Diagnosis require 3 or more oints lasting over 6 weeks

### Risk factors:
1. Woman
2. Age 20-40
### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any stiffness or warmth in the joint?"*
>"*Do you notice stiffness when you wake up? Does it last over one hour?*"

# Management
## Treatment

## Cervical subluxation management:
Cervical subluxaion management can need the following:
1. Cervival spine X-ray before surgery: Risk of neurological injury
2. Surgical treatment
3. [[DMARD]] therapy

## Drug overview

## Criteria
### Example severity/test score:
![[Asthma#^6df757]]

^6df757

---

# Complications
1. Cervical subluxation: It is a possible life-threatening spinal cord compression occuring at the [[Glossary#^8e8608|Atlantoaxial joint]]. It may require surgery, and DMARD therapy. See [[#Cervical subluxation management:]] ^7c1724
2. Osteoporosis: Accelerates rate due to disease and the use of steroid treatment ^25f590
	1. 30% increase risk of major fracture
	2. 40% increase risk of hip fracture
