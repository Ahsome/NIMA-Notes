# Information
Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune infammation of the synovium. The *synovium* is a thin layer of tissues that line joints and tendon sheaths, and secretes hyaluronic acid to lubricate the joint space. It results in a **systemic disease** with **extra-articular complications**. It may wax and wave with flares.

Symptoms are **symmetrical**, as autoimmune conditions affect both sides of the body. It has a gradual onset of symptoms, and commonly involves the **wrists** and the **hands**. It classicly affects:
1. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Contrast with [[Osteoarhritis]], where MCP joints are spared
2. Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints

It does ***not involve the DIP***, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]. It also *does not* involve the Lumbar spine, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]. Exception is C1-C2, see [[#Examination findings]].

Diagnosis involves inflammatory arthritis of 3 or more joints, lasting *more than 6 weeks*

If a patient has [[Osteoporosis]], it is ***accelerated by RA***:
1. Disease itself accelerates [[Osteoporosis]]
2. Steroid treatment for [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] (See [[#Management]]) can worsen [[Osteoporosis]]
3. Leads to 30% increase in major fracture, 40% increase hip fracture

The leading cause of mortality with [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] is [[#^a37ddb|coronary disease]]

> [!Important]
- Palpable nodules are ***Pathognomonic*** for[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]. See [[#^7e02a2|Extra-articular features]] ^2d22d0
- Increases rate of [[Osteoporosis]]. See [[#^25f590|Complications > Osteoporosis]]
- Diagnosis require 3 or more joints lasting over 6 weeks
- csDMARD is first line with [[Methotrexate]], add bDMARD and tsDMARD only if not remissing well
- bDMARD and tsDMARD have *increased* **infection risk** ^9abca0
- If bDMARD or tsDMARD is used, screening should occur for latent TB, Hep B and Hep C ^cac2c3
- Leading cause of mortality with [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] is [[#^a37ddb|coronary disease]]

## Examination findings
Due to its auto-immune nature, there are [[#^b3bc46|Articular]] findings of [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]], and Extra-articular findings

# Management
## Overall management:
Management involves the following:
-   Induce and maintain clinical remission as early as possible
-   Produce a self-plan for identifying and managing pain
-   Optimise patient's immune status, due to increase risk of infection
	- e.g. Recommended vaccinations
-   Continual monitoring of complications and drug issues.
	- Includes monitoring of DMARD such as [[Methotrexate]]. See [[#^c0787c|Methotrexate use]]
	- Includes cervical subluxation and increased [[Osteoporosis]]. See [[#Complications]]
-  Educating patient about disease, and management. Recommend [[#Lifestyle:]]

Inducing remission and pain control depend on the following:
1. DMARD (Disease-Modifying antirheumatic drugs)
2. Pain control

## Clinical remission
Clinical remission requires the use of DMARDs. This is then followed by 12 weeks of observation. If no improvement is found, consider changing dosage, addition of new bDMARD or tsDMARD.

>[!Important]
>![[#^9abca0]]

**DMARDs**:
1. Protects joints from destruction
2. Provides long-term reduction in disease progression
3. Slow onsent, effect over weeks
4. Usually oral
5. Split into three groups:
	1. csDMARD: Conventional synthetic DMARD
	2. bDMARD: Biological DMARD
	3. tsDMARD: Targeted synthetic DMARD

Following options are recommended:

^c0787c
If *bDMARD* or *tsDMARD* are used, it is recommended that the following screening occurs:
1. Latent TB: Otherwise, biologics can cause a flare up
2. Hepatitis B
3. Hepatitis C

>[!Important]
>![[#^cac2c3]]

**Pain control**:
Pain control should be used until DMARDs take effect:
1. NSAID: Drug of choice for pain control
2. Corticosteroids: Use if NSAID is inadequate
	1. Can use short-term for symptom flairs

If the disease is well managed via DMARDs, the cause of the pain is likely non-inflammatory. For this, following is recommended:
1. Rest
2. Exercise therapy
3. CBT
4. Meditation
5. Nerve stimulation

If pain is likely inflammatory in cause, the following can be used:

| Pain treatment | Explanation                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Oral NSAID     | Use if the pain is thought to be inflammatory-based |
| Fish oil       | Mild anti-[[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] effect           |
| Opiods         | Very limited use, should be only short-term due to risk                                                    |

## Lifestyle management:
### Exercise
Land- and water-based aerobic exercises are beneficial for patients with rheumatoid arthritis at all stages of disease. Regular aerobic exercise improves physical function, helps maintain ideal body weight and also benefits psychological and cardiovascular health. Low-impact land exercise (eg stationary cycling, walking) or low- to moderate-intensity water-based exercise is preferred for patients with painful joints or high disease activity. Strengthening (anaerobic) exercise is also recommended to prevent muscle wasting. Weightbearing exercise improves bone health.

Patients may worry that rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is increased by exercise. Although some pain with exercise can be expected, patients should be reassured that the benefits of exercise significantly outweigh the risks.

### Diet
The role of diet in rheumatoid arthritis remains controversial. Several studies have shown that dietary modifications including strict vegan diets, gluten-free diets and the Mediterranean-style diet produce small reductions in rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. However, no single diet results in consistent improvement for all patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The Mediterranean-style diet, characterised by a high consumption of fruit, vegetables, cereals and legumes, a little red meat but more fish, olive oil as the main source of fat, and a moderate intake of wine, appears to be the most universally accepted dietary intervention; it has the added benefit of weight control and reducing cardiovascular risk.

### Smoking cessation
All patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be strongly advised to stop smoking. Not only is smoking linked to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, it is also linked to poor prognosis and is a predictor of poor response to therapy. Smoking also increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in a patient group already at increased risk. Patient resources and help for smoking cessation are available from the Quitnow website [URL].
