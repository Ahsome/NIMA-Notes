# Information
Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune infammation of the synovium. The *synovium* is a thin layer of tissues that line joints and tendon sheaths, and secretes hyaluronic acid to lubricate the joint space.

It results in a **systemic disease** with **extra-articular complications**. It may wax and wave with flares

Symptoms are **symmetrical**, as autoimmune conditions affect both sides of the body. It has a gradual onset of symptoms, and commonly involves the **wrists** and the **hands**. It classicly affects:
1. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Contrast with [[Osteoarhritis]], where MCP joints are spared
2. Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints

It does ***not involve the DIP***, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]. It also *does not* involve the Lumbar spine, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]
