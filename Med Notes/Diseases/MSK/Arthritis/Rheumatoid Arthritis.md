# Information
Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune infammation of the synovium. The *synovium* is a thin layer of tissues that line joints and tendon sheaths, and secretes hyaluronic acid to lubricate the joint space.

It results in a **systemic disease** with **extra-articular complications**. It may wax and wave with flares

Symptoms are **symmetrical**, as autoimmune conditions affect both sides of the body. It has a gradual onset of symptoms, and commonly involves the **wrists** and the **hands**. It classicly affects:
1. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Contrast with [[Osteoarhritis]], where MCP joints are spared
2. Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joints

It does ***not involve the DIP***, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]. It also *does not* involve the Lumbar spine, which is involved in [[Osteoarhritis]]. Exception is C1-C2, see [[#Examination findings]].

| Stiffness           | Classically a *morning stiffness* that lasts >1 hour. It improves with use<br>If <30 minutes of *morning stiffness*, think about [[Osteoarhritis]] |                                                                                                                                                    |

| Fatigue                 |             |

### Risk factors:
1. Woman
2. Age 20-40

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any stiffness or warmth in the joint?"*
>"*Do you notice stiffness when you wake up? Does it last over one hour?*"

# Management
## Treatment

## Cervical subluxation management:
Cervical subluxaion management can need the following:
1. Cervival spine X-ray before surgery: Risk of neurological injury
2. Surgical treatment
3. [[DMARD]] therapy

## Drug overview

## Criteria
### Example severity/test score:
![[Asthma#^6df757]]

^6df757

---

# Complications
1. Cervical subluxation: It is a possible life-threatening spinal cord compression occuring at the [[Glossary#^8e8608|Atlantoaxial joint]]. It may require surgery, and DMARD therapy. See [[#Cervical subluxation management:]] ^7c1724
