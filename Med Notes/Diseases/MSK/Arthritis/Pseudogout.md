# Information
Pseudogout, also called [[Pseudogout|Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease]], is the deoposition of **calcium pyrophosphate** in joints. It occurs in *older patients*, and those with [[Hemochromatosis]]

It is associated with:
1. Hypercalcemia
2. Hyperparathyroidism

It has **three** key manifestations:
1. Asymptomatic:
	1. Only discovered on imaging
	2. Specifically, **chondrocalcinosis**: calcification of cartilage
2. Acute arthritis: Similar to [[Gout]]
	1. Result after **parathyroidectomy**, due to fluctuations in calcium levels
3. Chronic joint disease: Similar to [[Osteoarhritis]]
	1. Progressive joint and cartilage degeneration
	2. Occurs in 50% of patients with CPPD
	3. Bony enlargement and tenderness, similar to [[Osteoarhritis]]

# History
### Symptoms
1. Symptomatic pseudogout:
	1. Pain, redness, warmth, swelling
	2. 50% cases involve Knee
		1. Contrast with [[Gout]], where it is commonly in the [[Glossary#^d61e39|Podagra]]
2. Chronic joint disease:
	1. Bony enlargement
	2. Tenderness
	3. Similar to [[Osteoarhritis]]

### Risk factors:
1. Older patients
2. Those with [[Hemochromatosis]]
	1. It can lead to pyrophosphate, which can bind to calcium and cause [[Pseudogout]]

# Management
## Treatment
It is *only* treated when there is a pseudogout attack. This can involve:
1. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection
2. NSAIDs
3. Colchicine

Prophylaxis includes: Colchicine

>[!Note] Chronic joint disease management
If chronic joint disease, treatment is the same as [[Osteoarhritis]]
