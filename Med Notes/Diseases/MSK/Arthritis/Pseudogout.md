# Information
Pseudogout, also called [[Pseudogout|Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease]], is the deoposition of **calcium pyrophosphate** in joints. It occurs in *older patients*, and those with [[Hemochromatosis]]

It is associated with:
1. Hypercalcemia
2. Hyperparathyroidism

It has **three** key manifestations:
1. Asymptomatic: Only discovered on imaging
2. Acute arthritis: Similar to [[Gout]]
3. Chronic joint disease: Similar to [[Osteoarhritis]]
