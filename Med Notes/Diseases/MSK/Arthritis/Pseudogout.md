# Information
Pseudogout, also called [[Pseudogout|Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease]], is the deoposition of **calcium pyrophosphate** in joints. It occurs in *older patients*, and those with [[Hemochromatosis]]

It is associated with:
1. Hypercalcemia
2. Hyperparathyroidism

It has **three** key manifestations:
1. Asymptomatic:
	1. Only discovered on imaging
	2. Specifically, **chondrocalcinosis**: calcification of cartilage
2. Acute arthritis: Similar to [[Gout]]
	1. Result after **parathyroidectomy**, due to fluctuations in calcium levels
3. Chronic joint disease: Similar to [[Osteoarhritis]]
	1. Progressive joint and cartilage degeneration
	2. Occurs in 50% of patients with CPPD
	3. Bony enlargement and tenderness, similar to [[Osteoarhritis]]

> [!Important]
1.  Pseudogout is the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate in joints.
2.  It occurs in older patients and those with hemochromatosis.
3.  Pseudogout is associated with hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism.
4.  It has three key manifestations: asymptomatic, acute arthritis, and chronic joint disease.
5.  Symptomatic pseudogout can cause pain, redness, warmth, and swelling.
6.  Chronic joint disease can cause bony enlargement and tenderness similar to osteoarthritis.
7.  Asymptomatic pseudogout can be discovered on imaging and involves chondrocalcinosis.
8.  Polarised light microscopy can reveal rhomboid crystals that are blue when parallel.
9.  Treatment for pseudogout attacks includes intraarticular glucocorticoid injection, NSAIDs, and colchicine.
10.  Prophylaxis includes colchicine, and chronic joint disease management is similar to osteoarthritis.

# History
### Symptoms
1. Symptomatic pseudogout:
	1. Pain, redness, warmth, swelling
	2. 50% cases involve Knee
		1. Contrast with [[Gout]], where it is commonly in the [[Glossary#^d61e39|Podagra]]
2. Chronic joint disease:
	1. Bony enlargement
	2. Tenderness
	3. Similar to [[Osteoarhritis]]

### Risk factors:
1. Older patients
2. Those with [[Hemochromatosis]]
	1. It can lead to pyrophosphate, which can bind to calcium and cause [[Pseudogout]]

# Management
## Treatment
It is *only* treated when there is a pseudogout attack. This can involve:
1. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection: 
	1. Preferred treatment for acute attacks in patients with a single affected joint.
2. NSAIDs:
	1. First-line treatment for patients with multiple affected joints or those who cannot tolerate glucocorticoids. They can be given orally or intravenously
3. Colchicine:
	1. Alternative treatment option in patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to glucocorticoids or NSAIDs

Prophylaxis includes: 
-   Colchicine is the preferred prophylactic agent for recurrent pseudogout attacks. It is usually given orally at a low dose (0.6 mg once or twice daily).
-   Other prophylactic agents that can be considered include NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine.

>[!Note] Chronic joint disease management
If chronic joint disease, treatment is the same as [[Osteoarhritis]]
