# Information 
*Septic Arthritis* is an **infection** of the **joints**. It can be acquired through several mechanisms:
1. Hematogenous spread
2. Contiguous spread ([[Osteomyelitis]])
3. Direct inoculation

It is usually mono-bacterial. Causes include:
1. [[Staph. Aureus]] including MRSA
2. Streptococci
3. Gram-negative rods

> [!Important]
- Symptoms occur **acutely**, and primarily are monoarthritic, specifically the **knee**. This differentiates it from [[Osteoarhritis]] and [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] ^1c8b1c

### Risk factors:
1. Pre-existing joint disease. These include:
	1. [[Osteoarhritis]]
	2. [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
	3. [[Med Notes/DIseases/MSK/Arthritis/Gout]]
2. IV drug use, can introduce bacteria
3. Immunosuppression including diabetes
