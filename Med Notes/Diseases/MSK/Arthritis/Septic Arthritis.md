# Information 
*Septic Arthritis* is an **infection** of the **joints**. It can be acquired through several mechanisms:
1. Hematogenous spread
2. Contiguous spread ([[Osteomyelitis]])
3. Direct inoculation

It is usually mono-bacterial. Causes include:
1. [[Staph. Aureus]] including MRSA
2. Streptococci
3. Neisseria gonorrhoeae in sexually active patients
4. Gram-negative rods

## Prosthetic joint:
Prosthetic joint can cause [[Med Notes/Diseases/MSK/Arthritis/Septic Arthritis\|Septic Arthritis]] with different microbiology:
1. Early onset (<3 months after surgery): [[Staph. Aureus]], gram-negative rods
2. Delayed onset (3 to 12 months): **Coagulase-negative staphlyococci** or enteroccoci
3. Late onset (>12 months): [[Staph. Aureus]], ram-negative bacilli, streptococci

> [!Important]
- Symptoms occur **acutely**, and primarily are monoarthritic, specifically the **knee**. This differentiates it from [[Osteoarhritis]] and [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] ^1c8b1c
- Blood cultures and synovial fluid analysis should occur *before* antibiotics are given
- Microbiology differns when infection of a [[#Prosthetic joint:]]. If delayed onset from surgery (3-12 months), likely **Coagulase-negative staphylococci** ^2cfd83

# History
### Symptoms
Symptoms are **acute**, and **monoarthritic**:
1. Single, swollen, painful join
2. Fever
3. Knee is most common join
	1. Less commonly wrists, ankles, or hips

>[!Important]
>![[#^1c8b1c]]

### Risk factors:
1. Pre-existing joint disease. These include:
	1. [[Osteoarhritis]]
	2. [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]]
	3. [[Med Notes/DIseases/MSK/Arthritis/Gout]]
2. IV drug use, can introduce bacteria
3. Immunosuppression including diabetes
4. **Prosthetic joint**

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any previous joint disease?"*
>*"Do you take any illicit drugs?"*
>*"Is it a prosthetic joint?"*

# Management
## Initial management
Initial management involves **blood cultures** and **synovial fluid analysis**. These should be done *before* antibiotics are involved. Synovial fluid analysis should show WBC cound > 50,000 -> 150,000. It should also be gram stained and cultured

Afterwards, treatment:
1. **Joint drainage** should be conducted
	1. In easy joints, utilise seriel aspiration, similar to management of an [[Abscess]]
	2. If hard joint, utilise [[Glossary#^8bf549|Arthroscopic drainage]] or [[Glossary#^c75edf|Arthrotomy]]
2. **Antibiotics**:

| Stain                        | Suspected Organism | Drug              | Reasoning                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Gram-positive cocci clusters | [[Staph. Aureus]]  | Vancomycin IV     | Effective, use if *high risk* of [[MRSA]]         |
| ^^                           | ^^                 | Flucloxacillin IV | Use if *low risk* of MRSA                         |
| Gram-positive cocci chain    | Streptococcus      | Ceftriaxone IV    | Covers Strep                                      |
| Gram-negative                | ???                | Ceftriaxone IV    | Covers Gram-neg                                   |
| Unknown                      | [[Staph. Aureus]]  | Vancomycin IV     | Most likely, use if *high risk* of [[MRSA]] |
| ^^                           | ^^                 | FLucloxacillin IV | Use if *low risk* of MRSA                                                  |
