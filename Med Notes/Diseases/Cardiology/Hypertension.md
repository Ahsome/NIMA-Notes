## Information
Hypertension is increase blood pressure in a patient, and it is dependent on age, cormobidities, past medical history, genetics, lifestyle factors etc.

### Hypertensive Urgency:
**Hypertensive Urgency** is severe hypertension (>180/120) without end-organ damage, but can still cause symptoms such as headache and nausea

### Hypertensive Emergency:
**Hypertensive Emergency** is severe hypertension (>220/140) *with* end-organ damage.
This can lead to the following issues:
![[#^12e30a]]

### Malignant Hypertension:
**Malignant Hypertension** refers to a [[#Hypertensive Emergency:]] that occurs with **papilledema**

> [!Important] 
- Diagnosis of hypertension *requires* **more than one** measurement ^4dbc79
- Screen every patient with new onset hypertension, and utilise pharmacologies if relevant indications exist. See [[Hypertension#Inital screening:]] and [[#^976242|Management > Compelling Indications]]
- Initial treatment should always be **lifestyle** factors. Only choose pharmacology after an attempt. See [[Hypertension#Initial management:]]

## Aetiology:
### Primary:
Primary (essential) is **the most common cause**, with no clear cause

### Secondary:
Secondary has some known cause:
- This is most commonly [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]
- Others include:
	- Hyperaldosteronism
	- Renal artery stenosis
	- Pheochromocytoma

### White coat hypertension
Hypertension only in the clinic, likely due to stress of being in a hospital setting. This can be solved utilising a [[Glossary#^dd845f|Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor]]

---

## Risk factors:
Risk factors include:
- Family history
- African-American race
- High salt intake
- Alcohol
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity

---

## Investigations:
### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis of hypertension _requires_ **more than one** measurement
It can be done via a [[Glossary#^dd845f|Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor]] for instances such as [[#White coat hypertension]]

| Stage           | SBP     | or | DBP   |
| --------------- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| Normal          | <120    | and | <80   |
| Prehypertension | 120-129 | and | <80   |
| Stage I         | 130-139 | or  | 80-89 |
| Stage II        | \> 140    | or  | \> 90   |
| Hypertensive    | \> 180    | or  | \> 120      |

### Complications:

| Test             | Disease                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| HbA1c            |[[Diabetes Mellitus]]|
| Fasting glucose  |^^|
| Lipid Panel      | Hyperlipidemia                           |
| ECG              | [[Myocardial Infarction]], check Q-waves |
| Serum creatinine | [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]               |
| Urine dipstick   | Proteinuria                                         |

## Management:
### Screening:
There should be an initial screening for any [[Hypertension#Complications|Complications and comorbid conditions]]. See [[Hypertension#Complications|Investigations > Complications]]

### Treatment:
Initial management should always be **lifestyle modification**, focused on **weight loss**. This is the most effective intervention. Pharmacological comes when lifestyle is restricted, or there are [[Hypertension#^39a12c|compelling indications]]

The second most effective intervention is the **DASH diet**. See [[Hypertension#DASH diet:|DASH diet table]]:
- Vegetables, fruits
- Whole grains
- Poultry, fish
- Low in sugar and red meats

Others include:
1. Exercise
2. Sodium restriction
3. Alcohol limitation

#### Pharmacological management:
Initial choices include:
1. [[Thiazide]] diuretics
2. [[ACEi]], [[ARB]]
3. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers

Compelling indications: ^39a12c

| Indication                      | Drug                   | Reasoning                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Prior [[Myocardial Infarction]] | [[Beta-blocker]]       | Helps with heart function     |
| [[Diabetes Mellitus]]           | [[ACEi]] or [[ARB]]    | Renal protective              |
| [[Osteoporosis]]                | [[Thiazide]] diuretics | Helps maintain calcium levels |
| Proteinuria                     | [[ACEi]] or [[ARB]]    | Renal protective                              | ^976242

### Sudden Hypertension:
Managing a *sudden hyperension* that has symptoms (i.e. [[#Hypertensive Urgency:]] or [[#Hypertensive Emergency]] requires a **gradual reduction** in blood pressure:
1. The MAP cannot reduce more than 25% to 30% in the first two hours
2. A rapid reduction results in ischemia and damage
3. The goal is <160/100mmHg

For a [[#Hypertensive Urgency:]], if the patient takes antihypertensives and missed a dose, **restart the dose**
If the patient does not take antihypertensives or did not miss a dose, use the following:
1. Nifedipine
2. Captopril
3. Clonidine
4. Prazosin
5. Amlodipine
	1. Slower, so use in less severe cases

For a [[#Hypertensive Emergency:]], the use of drug therapy is recommended as it is a life-threatening situation. The following IV drugs are recommended:



Drug choices include:
