# Information
Hypertension is increase blood pressure in a patient, and it is dependent on age, cormobidities, past medical history, genetics, lifestyle factors etc.

## Hypertensive Urgency:
**Hypertensive Urgency** is severe hypertension (>180/120) without end-organ damage

## Hypertensive Emergency:
**Hypertensive Emergency** is severe hypertension (>180/120) *with* end-organ damage. This can lead to the following issues:
![[#^]]


> [!Important] 
- Diagnosis of hypertension *requires* **more than one** measurement ^4dbc79
- Screen every patient with new onset hypertension, and utilise pharmacologies if relevant indications exist. See [[Hypertension#Inital screening:]] and [[#^976242|Management > Compelling Indications]]
- Initial treatment should always be **lifestyle** factors. Only choose pharmacology after an attempt. See [[Hypertension#Initial management:]]

## Aetiology:
### Primary:
Primary (essential) is **the most common cause**, with no clear cause

### Secondary:
Secondary has some known cause:
- This is most commonly [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]
- Others include:
	- Hyperaldosteronism
	- Renal artery stenosis
	- Pheochromocytoma

### White coat hypertension
Hypertension only in the clinic, likely due to stress of being in a hospital setting

---

## Risk factors:
Risk factors include:
- Family history
- African-American race
- High salt intake
- Alcohol
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity

## Investigations:
### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis of hypertension _requires_ **more than one** measurement
| Stage           | SBP     | or | DBP   |
| --------------- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| Normal          | <120    | and | <80   |
| Prehypertension | 120-129 | and | <80   |
| Stage I         | 130-139 | or  | 80-89 |
| Stage II        | \> 140    | or  | \> 90   |
| Hypertensive    | \> 180    | or  | \> 120      |

### Complications:
| Test             | Disease                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| HbA1c            | [[Diabetes Mellitus]]                    |
| Fasting glucose  | ^^                                       |
| Lipid Panel      | Hyperlipidemia                           |
| ECG              | [[Myocardial Infarction]], check Q-waves |
| Serum creatinine | [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]               |
| Urine dipstick   | Proteinuria                                         |

## Management:
### Initial screening:
There should be an initial screening for any [[Hypertension#Complications|Complications and comorbid conditions]]. See [[Hypertension#Complications|Investigations > Complications]]

### Initial management:
Initial management should always be **lifestyle modification**, focused on **weight loss**. This is the most effective intervention. Pharmacological comes when lifestyle is restricted, or there are [[Hypertension#^39a12c|compelling indications]]

The second most effective intervention is the **DASH diet**. See [[Hypertension#DASH diet:|DASH diet table]]:
- Vegetables, fruits
- Whole grains
- Poultry, fish
- Low in sugar and red meats

Others include:
1. Exercise
2. Sodium restriction
3. Alcohol limitation

### Pharmacological management:
Initial choices include:
1. [[Thiazide]] diuretics
2. [[ACEi]], [[ARB]]
3. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers

Compelling indications: ^39a12c

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Prior [[Myocardial Infarction]] | [[Beta-blocker]]       | Helps with heart function     |
| [[Diabetes Mellitus]]           | [[ACEi]] or [[ARB]]    | Renal protective              |
| [[Osteoporosis]]                | [[Thiazide]] diuretics | Helps maintain calcium levels |
| Proteinuria                     | [[ACEi]] or [[ARB]]    | Renal protective                              | ^976242
