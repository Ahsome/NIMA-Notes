# Information
*Decompensated heart failure* (chronic) can be divided into two types:

**1. *Heart failure preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)* –** ==LV EF > 50%==
- Diastolic dysfunction 
- Clinically, a patient displays signs and symptoms of RHS heart failure, but on echo, have a normal ejection fraction. 
- **Potentially**, the pathology resides in the mitral valve, left atrium, pulmonary vasculature or right ventricle?
- Mx - diuresis, SGLT2 inhibitors 

**2. *Heart failure reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)* –** ==LV EF < 50%==
- Systolic dysfunction
- Usually has gradually dilating left ventricle chamber and has pumping defects.
- <30% = severe 
- 30-40% = moderate
- 40-50s% = mild
- For 40 and less % - ARNI - Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNi) is **a medicine resulting from the combination of two anti-hypertensive drugs (sacubitril and valsartan) that reduce blood pressure**.
	- 48hr washout period between taking off ACEi and ARNI otherwise you will cause angioedema 
- SGLT2 inhibitor - Dapoglifizin, empagliflozin
	- Can use instead of diuretic and it has better prognostic outcome

Most heart failure has an aeitiology behind the acute presentation, and needs to be treated to prevent further decompensation, as well as treating the acute symptoms of heart failure itself.

## Aeitiology 
-   Arrhythmia - [[Atrial Fibrillation]]!
-   Fluid overload - non-compliance with diuretics, drinking too much,etc.
-   Infection - fevers? malaise? cough? [[pneumonia]]?
-   **Ischaemic heart disease (post MI) –** 40%
-   **Dilated cardiomyopathy (often alcohol related) –** 32%
-   **Primary valvular heart disease –** 12%
-   **Hypertensive heart disease –** 11%
-   **Left ventricular hypertrophy –** very prominent feature of evolving HF. This may be because of valvular disease, chronic HTN etc.
-   [[Anaemia]] - ask about fatigue? diet - red meats? functional MI
-   Thyrotoxicosis


# History
## Signs
-   Symptoms of LV failure:
    -   Dyspnoea - at rest? on exertion? exercise tolerance?
    -   Orthopnoea - in the supine position? how many pillows?
    -   PND - do you wake at night from SOB?
-   Symptoms of RV failure:
    -   Peripheral oedema - leg swelling?
    -   Ascites - belly swelling?
    -   Anorexia - feeling bloated?
    -   Angina?

More questions
-   Last heart check:
    -   TOE? TTE?
    -   EF? changes to EF?
    -   ECG?
    -   Angiograms?
- Social Hx
    -   Type of house? Any stairs?
    -   ADLs
    -   Coping at home? Any help?
    -   Don’t forget to ask about smoking!

## Risk factors 
- HTN, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, FmHx, obesity
- IHD, valvular disease, previous cardiac surgery, transplant
- Alcohol? Smoking?
- Takotsubo?

## Examination findings

## Investigations

**Chest X-ray (CXR) (ABCDE)**
-   **A –** alveolar oedema (batwing appearance of hilum)
-   **B –** Kerley B lines
-   **C –** cardiomegaly (PA)
-   **D –** dilated upper lobe vessels
-   **E –** pleural effusion

**Echocardiogram (TOE or TTE) –** assess structural abnormalities, ventricular function, flow
-   **LVEF –** ejection fraction is the surrogate marker for systolic function of the LV. Often the most important for determining whether this is HF or not.
-   **Dimensions of the chambers –** enlargement and dilation? Hypertrophy?
-   **Valves –** regurgitation? Stenosis? Potential aetiology for HF?
-   **Colour doppler –** shows flow through the valves
    
**BNP –** increased BNP points to heart failure. It is released when there is increased atrial stretch.
    
**ECG –** assess for arrhythmias and ischaemic events that may have resulted in an acute decompensation.
-   Evidence of old infarcts
-   Left bundle branch block (common in HF)
    
**Electrolytes –** derangements in K+ can be the aetiology of arrhythmias.**Creatinine and eGFR –** acute decompensated heart failure can cause a pre-renal AKI. Check for renal failure markers.

**FBC –** check Hb, MCV, B12, folate and iron studies to check if anaemia is the aetiology.

# Management
## Treatments
### *Management of acute pulmonary oedema*
-   40mg frusemide IV (double their usual dose if already on frusy)
-   Oxygen supplementation if SpO2 < 94%
	- NIV if good for fluid management
-   GTN spray if BP > 100mmHg, to increase peripheral pooling of blood, reducing pulmonary congestion
- - Daily weight measurements – if there is a large increase in weight, such as 2kg over a few days, this indicates that there is a significant retention.
- In-patient echo
- Telemetry / daily ECGs
- Smoking cessation
- Recheck troponins the next day
- Check potassium and U&Es because of frusemide 


### Long-term *Management of heart failure*
#### Non-pharmacologic management
- Low salt diet – to prevent fluid retention - <2g per day
- Fluid restriction – 1.5L for congestion
- Smoking cessation
- GP follow-up within a week
- Cardiac rehab or cardiac health team
- Multidisciplinary heart failure team, including a pharmacist to go through the medications (esp. if you are up-titrating), cardiologist, dietician (fluid and salt restriction diet)

#### Pharmacological treatment
-   ACEi (pril) – vital initial treatment for all HFrEF patients. Start low dose, then up- titrate. THEN, add on b blocker.  
	- ARB (sartan) – used if ACEi are not tolerated.  
	- SE – cough, hypotension, hyperkalaemia  
	- Contraindications – renal artery stenosis, pregnancy and angio-oedema
-  b blockers (olol) (cardioselective) – first line Tx, which decreases cardiac workload
	- Bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate (long-release), nebivolol  
	- ==BUT, in acute decompensation, take them off currently because it’s a negative inotrope==.
		- If they are on for long-term, maybe just continue, but never start them on a new bblocker
-   Aldosterone antagonist (one) (NYHA >/= 2) (EF < 35% and still symptomatic)
	- Spironolactone – RALES trial showed reduction in mortality, rate of hospitalisation and reduction of HF symptoms  
	- Eplerenone – EPHESUS and EMPHASIS trial showed reduction in all cause and CVS mortality in HF patients 
	- ISSUES – hyperkalaemia in CKD patients.
-   Diuretics – used to reduce the symptoms of fluid overload. Good for improving quality of life. There is no evidence that it improves mortality.
	- Frusemide, thiazides (SPIRO counts too)
-   Digoxin (last line) – positive inotrope and is the last line therapy in end stage heart failure patients. Improves cardiac output.  
	- Useful as it wont lower your blood pressure - 500mg if renal function is ok
	- Renal excretion – careful dosing in CKD.

#### Devices
- 3 months after (timeframe)
- ICD or pacemaker – the major cause of sudden death in CCF patients is that of a spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. Hence ICD will shock them out of this rhythm. This improves prognosis.
- Biventricular pacing (cardiac resychronisation therapy - CRT specifically when you have a LBBB) and implantable cardiac defibrillator 


# Complications
1. [[Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD)]]
2. [[Sleep Apnea]]: Central sleep anea due to causing Cheyne-Stokes breathing
	1. Cyclic breathing due to delayed detection to changes in PaCO2
