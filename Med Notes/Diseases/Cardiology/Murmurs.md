	- Late-peaking murmur
	- Soft / quiet S2
	- Weak and smalll carotid pulses 
	- Left venticular hypertrophy - voltage criteria (S wave in V1 and R wave in V5 and V6 > 35mm)
- MR
	- Holosystolic murmur, pansystolic
	- Head best at 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
	- Same murmur as AS
	- VALSALVA - increases HCM murmur and decreases AS
	- Decreases venous return and preload
- VSD

- Always pathologic
- AR - decrendo, "blowing"
- MS - diastolic, "rumbling", opening "snap" loud S1
