# Information
Coronary Artery Disease is a **narrowing** due to [[atherosclerosis]]. It is asymptomatic until 75% of the artery lumen is occluded. The main symptom is **chest pain**, called *angina*. It exists on a spectrum:
![[Pasted image 20230516183317.png]]
## Stable Angina:
Plaque occluding â€”75% or more of coronary artery
-  Causes "typical" chest pain
-  Pressure-like chest pain
-  Occur with exertion
-  Relived by rest or nitroglycerine
-  EKG at rest: normal
-  Symptoms at rest: absent

Diagnosis: symptoms or stress testing
-  Stress testing key when diagnosis uncertain

# History
### Symptoms
1. Chest pain (angina)
	1. Pain worse on exertion
2. Dyspnea
3. Palpitations
4. Sweating

**Comparison**:
| Symptom       | Stable Angina | Unstable Angina | NSTEMI | STEMI |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Chest pain |On exertion <br>Relieved by [[GTN]]|    At rest             |        |       |

### Risk factors:
Highest risk. Essentially has the same risk as having known [[Coronary Artery Disease]]:
1. [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
2. [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]

Other risk factors:
1. [[Hypertension]]
2. [[Hyperlipidemia]]
3. Age (M > 45, F > 55)
4. Family history of ***premature*** [[Coronary Artery Disease]]
	1. 1st degree M < 55
	2. 1st degree F < 65
	3. **Not if not premature**
5. Smoking
	1. Quitting significantly reduces risk
6. [[Obesity]], sedentary lifestyle

# Management
## Treatment

## Stable Angina Management:
1. Given no symptoms at rest ([[#Symptoms]]) and no ECG changes ([[#Investigations]]), you need to do **stress testing** OR **angiography**
	1. Stress testing:
		2. Use when diagnosis is uncertain
		3. Patient **must be** **asymptomatic**
		4. Goal: provoke ischemia and detect ischemia
		5. Provocation: exercise always preferred
		6. Can **only identify** ischemia due to flow-limiting" stenosis (usually >75%)
			1. Non-flow limiting lesions are smaller plaques, not detected
			2. Can break off, cause Acute MI, can happen despite neg stress test
		7. Detection:
			1. ECG changes (ST-depressions). If hard to identify:
			2. Nuclear imaging (usually Technetium)
				3. ![[Pasted image 20230516184358.png|100]]
				4. Normal vs stress
			3. Echocardiography
				1. Check contractility
				2. If wall is ischemic, it will contract less vigirously (hypokinetic)
			4. If cannot exercise:
				1. Pharmacologic nuclear (induce coronary steal by **vasodilation**). Vasodilators:
					1. Regadenoson
					2. Dipyrimadole
					3. Adenosine
					4. Persantine
					7. Contraindication: reactive airway disease/wheezing, [[COPD]]
				7. Dobutamine stress echocardiography
					1. Dobutamine is beta 1 agonist, increase HR and contractility like exercise
					2. DO echo, check to see if blood vessel not contract properly
					3. Risk of arrhythmias
		8. Angiography
			1. Invansive technique, catheter is inserted and dye is injected
			2. ![[Pasted image 20230516185234.png]]
			3. You can see the narrowing in the center of the LAD
