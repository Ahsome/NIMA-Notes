# Information
Coronary Artery Disease is a **narrowing** due to [[atherosclerosis]]. It is asymptomatic until 75% of the artery lumen is occluded. The main symptom is **chest pain**, called *angina*. It exists on a spectrum:
![[Pasted image 20230516183317.png]]
## Stable Angina:
Plaque occluding â€”75% or more of coronary artery
-  Causes "typical" chest pain
-  Pressure-like chest pain
-  Occur with exertion
-  Relived by rest or nitroglycerine
-  EKG at rest: normal
-  Symptoms at rest: absent

Diagnosis: symptoms or stress testing
-  Stress testing key when diagnosis uncertain

>[!Important] Typical Case of Stable Angina:
>- 65yo man chest pain while walking
>- Relieved with rest
>- Presents to ED:
>	- ECG normal
>	- Biomarkers normal
>- Stress:
>	- Walks on treadmill --> chest pain, EKG changes
>- Cardiac catherisation performed, 90% LAD artery lockage
>- Stent placed, angina resolved
>- Placed on aspirin and statin, lifetime

> [!Important]
- Patient is put on dual-antiplatelet therapy. If a patient has a thrombosis from a stent, almost always due to not keeping with antiplatelet therapy

3. Palpitations

Highest risk. Essentially has the same risk as having known [[Coronary Artery Disease]]:

2. [[Hyperlipidemia]]
3. Age (M > 45, F > 55)

	1. 1st degree M < 55
	2. 1st degree F < 65
	3. **Not if not premature**
5. Smoking
	1. Quitting significantly reduces risk
6. [[Obesity]], sedentary lifestyle

# Management
## Treatment

## Stable Angina Management:
Stable angina management involves:
1. Confirming of [[Coronary Artery Disease]] via the use of **stress testing** *or* **angiography**
2. Preventative therapy, to reduce mortality and myocardial infarction in the future
3. Stent or CABG surgery
	1. Stent thrombosis prevent with "Dual antiplatelet therapy" ^six45w
	2. Aspirin + Clopidogrel (can be prasugrel or ticagrelor, all P2Y12r antagonists)
	3. Done for one year
	4. After one year, stent metal no longer exposed to blood as scar tissue and endothelial growth
	5. Most patients only take aspirin from this

### Initial testing:
1. Given no symptoms at rest ([[#Symptoms]]) and no ECG changes ([[#Investigations]]), you need to do **stress testing** OR **angiography**
	1. Stress testing:
		2. Use when diagnosis is uncertain
		3. Patient **must be** **asymptomatic**
		4. Goal: provoke ischemia and detect ischemia
		5. Provocation: exercise always preferred
		6. Can **only identify** ischemia due to flow-limiting" stenosis (usually >75%)
			1. Non-flow limiting lesions are smaller plaques, not detected
			2. Can break off, cause Acute MI, can happen despite neg stress test
		7. Detection:
			1. ECG changes (ST-depressions). If hard to identify:
			2. Nuclear imaging (usually Technetium)
				3. ![[Pasted image 20230516184358.png|100]]
				4. Normal vs stress
			3. Echocardiography
				1. Check contractility
				2. If wall is ischemic, it will contract less vigirously (hypokinetic)
			4. If cannot exercise:
				1. Pharmacologic nuclear (induce coronary steal by **vasodilation**). Vasodilators:
					1. Regadenoson
					2. Dipyrimadole
					3. Adenosine
					4. Persantine
					7. Contraindication: reactive airway disease/wheezing, [[COPD]]
				7. Dobutamine stress echocardiography
					1. Dobutamine is beta 1 agonist, increase HR and contractility like exercise
					2. DO echo, check to see if blood vessel not contract properly
					3. Risk of arrhythmias
		8. Angiography
			1. Invansive technique, catheter is inserted and dye is injected
			2. ![[Pasted image 20230516185234.png]]
			3. You can see the narrowing in the center of the LAD

### Management
1. Preventative therapy (reduce risk of mortality and MI)
	1. Aspirin
	2. Statin
	3. Do not help with symptoms, only mortality
2. Anti-anginal therapy (lowers O2 demand)
	1. Beta blocker or Ca2+ channel blocker, decrease HR and contractility
	2. GTN, decrease pre-load
3. Coronary stent implantation
	1. Also called PCI
	2. Worry about [[Coronary Artery Disease#^bhs3lc|Complications of stent]]
4. CABG surgery
	1. Bypass surgery
	2. Bypass occlusion by using another artery/vein to bypass bloc
		1. Left Internal Mamary Artery
		2. Saphenous Vein
		3. Radial (arm) artery graft

# Complications
1. Complications of disease
2. Complication of **stent**:
	1. Restenosis:
		1. Slow, steady growth of scar tissue over stent. Called 'Neoo-intimal hyperplasia'
		2. Re-occlusion of vessel
		3. Rarely life, threating
		4. Slow, steady return of angina
		5. To fix, most stents coated with with drugs
			1. Metal stent covered with polymer, which is impregnated with drug to prevent tissue growth
			2. [[Sirolimus]] ^bhs3lc, an anti-eluting
	2. Thrombosis:
		1. Acute closure of stent
		2. Same as [[#STEMI]], life-threatening event
		3. Dual anti-platelet therapy for prevention
		4. Associated with **missed medication doses**
