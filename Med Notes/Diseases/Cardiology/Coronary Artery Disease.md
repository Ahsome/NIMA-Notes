# Information
Coronary Artery Disease is a **narrowing** due to [[atherosclerosis]]. It is asymptomatic until 75% of the artery lumen is occluded. The main symptom is **chest pain**, called *angina*. It exists on a spectrum:
![[Pasted image 20230516183317.png]]
This can be thought of as two main categories:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome, consisting off:
	1. Unstable angina
	2. NSTEMI
	3. STEMI
2. Others
	1. [[#Stable Angina:]]
	2. [[#Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina:]]

## Acute Cornonary Syndrome
This is due to **plaque rupture**, causing **thrombus formation**
If it causes a subtotal occlusion/subendocardial ischemia, this causes:
1. [[#Unstable angina]]
2. [[#NSTEMI]] 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20230516192614.png|150]]

If there is total occlusion/transmural ischemia, it causes:
1. [[#STEMI]] 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20230516192640.png|150]]

### Unstable angina
Ischemic symptoms occuring with increasing frequency or at rest, with *negative* biomarkers
See [[#^9a1da4|Typical case of UA/NSTEMI]]

### NSTEMI
Ischemic symptoms occuring with increasing frequency or at rest, with *positive* biomarkers

>[!Important] Typical Case of [[#Unstable angina]]/[[#NSTEMI]]:
>- 65yo man chest pain at rest
>- Biomarkers elevated
>- Absence of ST-segment elevations
>- Medical Therapy
>	- [[Aspirin]]
>	- [[Metoprolol]]
>	- Heparin drip
>- Admitted to cardiac floor
>- Hospital day 2 --> Angiography
>- 90% blockage of LAD --> Stent

^9a1da4

### STEMI
ST-ELevation myocardial Infarction
Angina at rest, with **ST-segment elevation**:
![[Pasted image 20230516195235.png]]

**Depending on location of MI, complication:**
Inferior MI:
1. Right ventricular infarction ^hp8n7h
	1. This means not only infarction of inferior left wall, also causes right wall infarction
	2. Occurs in inferior STEMI (II, III, aVF)
	3. Loss of right ventricular contractility
	4. Elevated **JVP
		1. Decreases preload to left ventricle, causes hypotension
	5. Avoid GTN
		1. It dilates veins, reduces preload, will increase [[Hypotension]]
	6. Treat with IV fluids
		1. Increase preload
	7. **Diagnose wit right-sided chest leads**
		1. Put leads on right side, see if infarct occurs
2. Sinus bradycardia and heart block ^vacvav
	1. Causes dysfunction in SA node and AV node
	2. Due to supply from RCA
	3. Avoid beta-blockers
3. [[Coronary Artery Disease#^xomu07|Papillary muscle rupture]] post MI, after 5-10 days
4. [[Coronary Artery Disease#^gp9l2x|Ventricular Pseudoaneurysm]] post MI, 1-2 weeks

Anterior MI:
1. [[Cardiogenic shock]]
	1. Usually from large anterior STEMI
	2. Cause hypotension, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, respiratory distress
2. [[Coronary Artery Disease#^84fa7v|Ventricular Aneurysm]], after weeks

>[!Important] Typical Case of [[#STEMI]]:
>- Arrival in ER with chest pain 5:42pm
>- ECG done 5:50pm, identifies STEI
>- Cardiac cath lab ctivated for emergent angioplasty
>- Meds given in ER
>	- Aspirin
>	- Heparin bolus
>	- Metoprolol
>	- Nitro drip
>- If cath lab available:
>	- Transport to cath lab 6:15pm
>	- Artery opened with balloon 6:42PM
>	- DTB time 60 minutes (ideal < 90 min)
>- Else:
>	- tPA given based on weight 6:07pm
>	- IV push
>	- Door to neededle time 25 min (ideal <120)
		


## Non-Acute Coronary Syndromes
### Stable Angina:
Plaque occluding —75% or more of coronary artery
-  Causes "typical" chest pain
-  Pressure-like chest pain
-  Occur with exertion
-  Relived by rest or nitroglycerine
-  EKG at rest: normal
-  Symptoms at rest: absent

Diagnosis: symptoms or stress testing
-  Stress testing key when diagnosis uncertain

>[!Important] Typical Case of [[#Stable Angina:]]:
>- 65yo man chest pain while walking
>- Relieved with rest
>- Presents to ED:
>	- ECG normal
>	- Biomarkers normal
>- Stress:
>	- Walks on treadmill --> chest pain, EKG changes
>- Cardiac catherisation performed, 90% LAD artery lockage
>- Stent placed, angina resolved
>- Placed on aspirin and statin, lifetime

### Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina:
Due to episodic *vasoconstriction* of coronayr vessels **at rest**
Happens midnight to **early morning**, and *can improve* with exertion
1. If they wake up in the morning with chest pain, it is a classic sign of [[#Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina:]]
Associated with smoking
Diagnosis primairly on history

> [!Important]
- Patient is put on dual-antiplatelet therapy. If a patient has a thrombosis from a stent, almost always due to not keeping with antiplatelet therapy
- Always obtain ECG in all chest pain patients. ST elevation is key differentiatior in [[#Acute Cornonary Syndrome]] between [[#Unstable angina]], [[#NSTEMI]] and [[#STEMI]]

## Investigations
### Biomarkers:
Biomarkers that are often used for [[Coronary Artery Disease]]:
1. Troponin I or T
	1. Most commonly used
	2. Increase 2-4 hours after MI
	3. Stay elevated for weeks
3. CK-MB
	1. Increase 4-6 hours after MI
	2. Normalise within 2-3 days
	3. Very good for re-infarction
		1. This is because it goes quickly, so you can see if there is a second MI while the Troponin will remain high ^81req3


|Key Findings| Result   |Explanation|
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
|Troponin I or T|High 2-4hr, maintain 2-3 week|Damage to heart muscle|
|CK-MB|High 4-6hr, maintain 2-3 days|Good for reinfarction. See [[Coronary Artery Disease#^81req3\|Explanation]]|

### ECG:
For **STEMI:**
- Anterior MI: V1-V4
	- Due to occlusion of LAD
- Lateral: I, aVL, V5 and V6
	- Due to occlusion of Left Circumflex Artery
- Inferior: II, III, aVF
	- Due to occlusion of RCA, 90%
	- Minority Left Circumflex Artery, 10%
- Posterior: V7-V9
	- With ST-depressions in anterior standard leads, such as V2-V4
- Left Main Occlusion: ST-elevation **only in aVR**
	- Due to blockage of Left Main Coronary Artery, which branches into LAD and LCX
	- Also shows diffuse ST depressions and T-wave inversios


**Comparison**
| Test |[[#Stable Angina]]|[[#Unstable Angina]]|[[#NSTEMI]]|[[#STEMI]]|
| ---- | ------------- | --------------- | ------ | ----- |

# Management
---

## STEMI Management:
"Time is muscle"
As coronary artery is occluded by thrombus, longer occlusion leads to more dead muscle and increased symptoms of [[Heart Failure]]
It is a **medical emergency**

Management involves:
1. Treating the **thrombotic** and **ischemic** problem. Medical therapy here is *supportive*
2. Revascularise the tissue
3. Deal with complications of Ischemia

### Medical THerapy:
1. Thrombotic problem:
	1. Aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation
	2. Heparin to inhibit clot formation
2. Ischemic problem:
	1. Beta-blockers to reduce O2 demand
		1. Note: Inferior MI can cause [[Coronary Artery Disease#^vacvav|Bradycardia and AV block]].
		2. Beta-blockers can exacerbate that
	2. Nitrates to reduce O2 demand
		1. Note: Inferior MI can cause [[Coronary Artery Disease#^hp8n7h|RCA occlusion]]. This can lead to RV infarct, lowering pre-load
		2. Given nitratres lower preload, they can cause [[Hypotension]]
3. Other drugs:
	1. Clopidogrel: ADP receptor blocker, inhibits platelets
	2. Eptifibatide IIB/IIIA reeptor blocker, inhibits platelets
	3. Bivalirudin: Direct thrombin inhibitor, inhibits clot formation

### Revacularisation
1. Option 1: Emergency angioplasty
	1. Mechanical opening of artery
	2. Stent  placement should be done <90 minutes\
2. Option 2: Thrombolysis
	1. Alteplase, TPA, clot-bustinf drugg
	2. Should be done <120 minutes

### Complications of Ischemia:
Summary:
| Time        | Issues                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
|4 days|Arrhythmia|
|5-10 days|[[Coronary Artery Disease#^ip1god\|Free wall rupture]]|
|^^ | [[Cardiac Tamponade]]    |
|^^|[[Coronary Artery Disease#^xomu07\|Papillary muscle rupture]]|
|^^|[[Coronary Artery Disease#^8ht42u\|VSD (Septal rupture)]] |
|^^|[[Coronary Artery Disease#^4tn7k6\|Fibrinous Pericarditis]]|
|Weeks later|[[Coronary Artery Disease#^ynxakc\|Dressler's Syndrome]] |
|^^|[[Aneurysm]]|
|^^| LV Thrombus/CVA          |

**0-4 days:**
- Biggest issue is due to sudden cardiac death from [[Ventricular Tachycardia]], leads to [[Ventricular Fibrillation]] and cardiac arrest

**5-10 days**:
- Necrosis of the wall occurs
- Best test for all, transthoracic echocardiogram
- Free wall rupture: ^ip1god
	- Usually fatal, sudden death.
	- Can lead to [[Cardiac Tamponade]]
- Mitral valvle papillary muscle rupture: ^xomu07
	- Acute [[mitral regurgitation]] ((holosystolic murmur))
	- [[Heart Failure]], Respiratory Distress
	- More common in inferior MIs
- [[VSD]] - Septal rupture ^8ht42u
	- Loud, holosystlic murmur (thrill)
	- Hypotension, right [[Heart Failure]]. Increases JVP, edema
- Fibrinous Pericardidits ^4tn7k6
	- Occurs *days* after MI. As opposed to [[Coronary Artery Disease#^ynxakc\|Dressler's Syndrome]], which takes weeks to months
	- Not-autoimmune. As opposed to [[Coronary Artery Disease#^ynxakc\|Dressler's Syndrome]], which **is autoimune**
	- Due to myocardial inflammation have navigated into the muscle wall, causing pericarditis
	- Rarely life-threatening
	- Diagnosis: Clinical
	- No specific treatment

**Weeks later**: ^84fa7v
- Ventricular Aneurysm (3-4 weeks)
	- Portion of LV wall is replaced by scar tissue
	- More common in anterior infarction
	- Risk of thrombus, can break off and cause [[Stroke]] or peripheral embolism
	- If occurs, will cause persistent elevated ST elevations
- Ventricular Pseudonaeurysm (<2weeks) ^gp9l2x
	- Rupture contained by pericardium/scar tissue
	- Not a true aneurysm as does no bulging involve endocardium or myocardium
	- May rupture
	- Presents as chest pain or dyspnea
	- Often seen in **inferior wall**
	- Occulrs earlier (<2 weeks) than true anerurysm
- Dressler's Syndrome ^ynxakc
	- Form of [[Pericarditis]]
		- Causes chest pain
		- Causes Friction rub
	- Takes weeks to months. As opposed to [[Coronary Artery Disease#^4tn7k6|Fibrinous Pericarditis]], which takes days after MI
	- Immune-mediated (details not known) As opposed to [[Coronary Artery Disease#^4tn7k6|Fibrinous Pericarditis]], which is **not auto-immune**
	- Diagnosis is clinical
	- Treat with NSAIDs or Steroids

---

## UA/NSTEMI Management:
### Initial management:
This is a **thrombotic** and **ischemic** syndrome, like [[#STEMI]]: *However, there is ***no ticking clock***
1. Due to subtotal occlusion, so some blood flow to distal myocardium
2. No emergency angioplasty, no benefit for thrombolysis
3. However, because of coagulation, we need anti-coagulations
	1. Aspirin
	2. Heparin
4. Further drugs:
	1. Beta-blocker, unless contraindication
		1. [[Bradycardia]]
		2. [[Hypotension]]
5. Perform angioplasty, but not emergent, such as Hospital Day 2. See [[Coronary Artery Disease#^tf8nfo|PCI]] and [[Coronary Artery Disease#^85is4n|CABG]]
	1. Perform angiograph first to identify any blockage, then angioplasty

### Long term therapy:
No symptoms due to angioplasty. As such, the goal is to **reduce mortality and recurrent infarction**
1. Aspirin
2. Statin

Beta-blocker for prevention of recurrent disease
1. Strong indication in STEMI. **Always given**
2. Weak indication in NSTEMI/UA
3. Used for prevention in NSTEMI

---

## Stable Angina Management:
Stable angina management involves:
1. Confirming of [[Coronary Artery Disease]] via the use of **stress testing** *or* **angiography**
2. Preventative therapy, to reduce mortality and myocardial infarction in the future
3. Stent or CABG surgery
	1. Stent thrombosis prevent with "Dual antiplatelet therapy" ^six45w
	2. Aspirin + Clopidogrel (can be prasugrel or ticagrelor, all P2Y12r antagonists)
	3. Done for one year
	4. After one year, stent metal no longer exposed to blood as scar tissue and endothelial growth
	5. Most patients only take aspirin from this

### Initial testing:
1. Given no symptoms at rest ([[#Symptoms]]) and no ECG changes ([[#Investigations]]), you need to do **stress testing** OR **angiography**
	1. Stress testing:
		2. Use when diagnosis is uncertain
		3. Patient **must be** **asymptomatic**
		4. Goal: provoke ischemia and detect ischemia
		5. Provocation: exercise always preferred
		6. Can **only identify** ischemia due to flow-limiting" stenosis (usually >75%)
			1. Non-flow limiting lesions are smaller plaques, not detected
			2. Can break off, cause Acute MI, can happen despite neg stress test
		7. Detection:
			1. ECG changes (ST-depressions). If hard to identify:
			2. Nuclear imaging (usually Technetium)
				3. ![[Pasted image 20230516184358.png|100]]
				4. Normal vs stress
			3. Echocardiography
				1. Check contractility
				2. If wall is ischemic, it will contract less vigirously (hypokinetic)
			4. If cannot exercise:
				1. Pharmacologic nuclear (induce coronary steal by **vasodilation**). Vasodilators:
					1. Regadenoson
					2. Dipyrimadole
					3. Adenosine
					4. Persantine
					7. Contraindication: reactive airway disease/wheezing, [[COPD]]
				7. Dobutamine stress echocardiography
					1. Dobutamine is beta 1 agonist, increase HR and contractility like exercise
					2. DO echo, check to see if blood vessel not contract properly
					3. Risk of arrhythmias
		8. Angiography
			1. Invansive technique, catheter is inserted and dye is injected
			2. ![[Pasted image 20230516185234.png]]
			3. You can see the narrowing in the center of the LAD

### Management
1. Preventative therapy (reduce risk of mortality and MI)
	1. Aspirin
	2. Statin
	3. Do not help with symptoms, only mortality
2. Anti-anginal therapy (lowers O2 demand)
	1. Beta blocker or Ca2+ channel blocker, decrease HR and contractility
	2. GTN, decrease pre-load
3. Coronary stent implantation ^tf8nfo
	1. Also called PCI
	2. Worry about [[Coronary Artery Disease#^bhs3lc|Complications of stent]]
4. CABG surgery ^85is4n
	1. Bypass surgery
	2. Bypass occlusion by using another artery/vein to bypass bloc
		1. Left Internal Mamary Artery
		2. Saphenous Vein
		3. Radial (arm) artery graft

---

## Variant Angina Management
Overall management involves:
1. Quit smoking, biggest risk factors
2. Possibly **Calcium channel blockers, nitrates**
	1. Dihydropyridine CCB, such as amlodipine
	2. Vasodilators properties
	3. Dilate coronary arteries, oppose spasm
3. Normaly no beta blockers, *especially* [[Propranolol]]
	1. Nonselective beta blocker
	2. Can cause unopposed alpha stimulation
	3. Symptoms may worsen

## Criteria
### Example severity/test score:
![[Asthma#^6df757]]

^6df757

# Complications
1. Complications of disease
2. Complication of **stent**: ^bhs3lc
	1. Restenosis:
		1. Slow, steady growth of scar tissue over stent. Called 'Neoo-intimal hyperplasia'
		2. Re-occlusion of vessel
		3. Rarely life, threating
		4. Slow, steady return of angina
		5. To fix, most stents coated with with drugs 
			1. Metal stent covered with polymer, which is impregnated with drug to prevent tissue growth
			2. [[Sirolimus]] , an anti-eluting
	2. Thrombosis:
		1. Acute closure of stent
		2. Same as [[#STEMI]], life-threatening event
		3. [[Coronary Artery Disease#^six45w|Dual anti-platelet therapy for prevention]]
		4. Associated with **missed medication doses**
