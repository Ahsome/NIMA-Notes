 Lifestyle disease
 - associated with obesity, COPD, etc. 
 - Rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran
 
**CLASSIFICATION OF AF**
-   Paroxysmal AF (pAF) – lasts for more than 30 seconds but terminates spontaneously within 7 days of onset without intervention.
-   Persistent AF – constant state of AF which fails to resolve spontaneously within 7 days and will require cardioversion.
-   Long standing persistent AF – lasted for 12 months.
-   Permanent AF – when the pt/Dr decides not to pursue rhythm control.

[[Syncope#Management:]]

**CLINICAL PRESENTATION**
-   Risk factors – ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism
-   Acute presentation – palpitations, tachycardia, SOB
	- Pre-syncope, reduced exercise tolerance  
	- ?chest pain  
	- Exacerbation of [[Heart Failure]] Sx (AF as precipitating factor)
-   Ischaemic stroke – upon investigation for an ischaemic stroke (thromboembolic), AF may often be the underlying aetiology.


**INVESTIGATION**
-   ECG – lack of P waves, irregularly irregular RR interval
-   Inpatient telemetry/Holter monitor – can be more useful in pAF. But if it doesn’t catch an event, then it is again useless.
-   TOE – assesses LVEF and RVEF and potential structural causes for the AF, such as chamber dilatation that can be secondary to valvular regurgitation.  
	- ==TOE is best for observing thrombi in the LAA==. This is important to discern before cardioversion. If there is a thrombus, cardioversion can’t be performed due to the risk of embolization. Instead, thrombolysis should be tried before.
-   ==TFT== – hyperthyroidism can be a secondary cause of AF. Important to consider.


**TREATMENT**
Patients with newly diagnosed AF require thought about anticoagulation and whether to have rate or rhythm control. Patients with existing AF need evaluation of existing Tx.

*Prevention of embolization:*
-   **CHADS2VASC – widely used score to determine whether anticoagulation should be initiated. Score > 2 requires anticoagulation.**
-   HASBLED – bleeding risk in these pts should be considered in conjunction with  thromboembolic stroke and relative risk weighed up.
-   ==Warfarin – target INR 2.0 to 3.0 (2.5 ideal), 2.5 to 3.5 in mechanical valves==
-   NOAC/DOAC – rivaroxaban (Xarelto) most common

 Rate vs rhythm control – no evidence to any difference in mortality benefit, but it is important that rhythm control patients ALSO get rate control to prevent recurrence of AF episodes. Rate control is generally preferred in asymptomatic patients, and rhythm control in symptomatic patients...
-   Rate control – slowing of the heart rate by targeting the AV node. AFFIRM and RACE trials show slightly better long-term mortality benefits of rate control over rhythm.
	- **Beta blocker (1st line)** – atenolol, metoprolol  
	- **Non-dihydropyridine CCB (2nd line)** – verapamil, diltiazem (not great in CCF) 
	- **Digoxin (last line)** – be careful in CKD.
	
-   Rhythm control – ==percutaneous catheter ablation, anti-arrhythmic drugs==. In many patients, the pro-arrhythmic nature of anti-arrhythmics is not tolerated, especially in older patients. However, rhythm control is preferred in certain patients:
	- Symptomatic CCF patients 
	- Younger patients (<65YO)
	- Flecainide (Na)(1C)
	- Quinidine (Na)(1A)
	- Sotalol(b+K)  
	- Amiodarone (K)

Valvular AF – AF with a mitral valve lesion, especially stenosis. These MUST be anticoagulated with warfarin. The literature shows that DOACs can increase mortality rate.
- Mechanical valve – INR target should be 2.5 to 3.5.
