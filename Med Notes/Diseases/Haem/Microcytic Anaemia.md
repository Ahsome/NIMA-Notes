# Information
 
Anaemia is a condition of low RBC and oxygen-carrying capacity which causes symptoms of faitgue and weakness. Microcytic anaemia is usually due to ↓ hemoglobin in red cells. 

In anaemia of chronic disease, increased inflammation --> increased cytokines --> increased hepcidin --> iron trapped as ferritin in the liver

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Typically asymptomatic but symptoms include:
1. Weakness
2. Fatigue 
3. Dyspnoea
4. Palm crease pallour, nail bed palllour, conjunctival pallour 
5. Pica (craving non-food substances e.g. clay/dirt)
6. Restless leg syndrome

### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
| Microcytic iron-deficient anaemia | Normocytic Anaemia | Macrocytic Anaemia |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| - Menorrhagia (women of childbearing age)<br>- Reduced dietary intake<br>- Overt or occult blood loss (peptic ulcer, colon cancer)<br> - Malabsorption e.g. celiac or PPI (Fe2+ is easier to absorb than Fe3+, so Vitamin C deficiency reduces absoprtion)  |        |                    |

### *Questions to ask*
- "*Any significant bleeding in recent days? Menorrhagia for women?"
- *"Any GIT bleeding including melena / bloody stools?"*

## Investigations

***Microcytic Anaemia***
- Blood smear – shows the actual morphology of the RBCs and neutrophils
	- Iron deficiency anaemia – hypochromic microcytic
- GIT bleeding?
	- Endoscopy, colonoscopy, capsule – cancer? Angioectasia? Peptic ulcer? H. pylori? Dieulafoy’s lesion? Is there an obvious source of bleeding?
	- ASK ABOUT MELENA? Haematemesis? PR bleeding?
-   Stool testing – faecal occult blood (FOB)
-   Coeliac disease screen – can be a cause of GIT bleeding and malabsorption.

# Management
## Treatments
Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia
-   Identify and treat the underlying cause
	- Stop GIT bleeding
	- Control menorrhagia
- Supplement dietary intake – iron deficiency anaemia responds very well to oral supplementation
	- SEs:
		- Constipation, diarrhoea, N/V, epigastric pain
		- Black/green/tarry stools
-   Iron infusion – for severe anaemia, or people with malabsoprtion syndromes
	- ==INDICATION is Hb<70 == 
	- ==INDICATION is SYMPTOMATIC ANAEMIA==

## Criteria
### *Insert test severity or score (e.g. Chad-Vacs)*

2. OTHER CAUSES OF MICROCYTIC ANAEMIA

Thalassaemia

-   a and b thalassaemia – reduced production of either the a or b chain globin, hence
    
    resulting in faulty haemoglobin molecules.  
    o Hypochromic/microcytic RBC – TARGET CELLS  
    o Often high iron stores – due to ineffective erythropoiesis or large number of
    
    blood transfusions.
    
-   Anaemia of chronic disease – RBC can either be microcytic OR normocytic. Chronic
    
    inflammatory states result in iron sequestration intracellularly, resulting in reduced erythropoiesis and circulating iron. This is common in CKD, with the failure of secretion of EPO.
    
    o Transferrin/TIBC is LOW in anaemia of chronic disease, whereas it is HIGH in iron deficiency anaemia. In ACD, the body has no intention of trying to increase serum iron, as it is trying to sequester it away in cells.
