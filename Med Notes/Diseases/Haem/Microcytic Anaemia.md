# Information
 
Anaemia is a condition of low RBC and oxygen-carrying capacity which causes symptoms of faitgue and weakness. Microcytic anaemia is usually due to ↓ hemoglobin in red cells. 

In anaemia of chronic disease, increased inflammation --> increased cytokines --> increased hepcidin --> iron trapped as ferritin in the liver

Remember that ACD can be both microcytic or normocytic

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Typically asymptomatic but symptoms include:
1. Weakness
2. Fatigue 
3. Dyspnoea
4. Palm crease pallour, nail bed palllour, conjunctival pallour 
5. Pica (craving non-food substances e.g. clay/dirt)
6. Restless leg syndrome
7. Lead poisoning: abdo pain, anorexia, confusion, behavioural changes, poor concentration


### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
| Iron-deficient anaemia                                                                                                                                           | Thalassemia | ACD | Sideroblastic Anaemia | Lead poisoning                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Menorrhagia (women of childbearing age) | Reduced production of either the a or b chain globin, hence resulting in faulty haemoglobin molecules            |  Chronic disease   |    B6 deficiency (isoniazid treatment for TB)                   | Work + inhaled fumes(battery factory) |
| Reduced dietary intake                                                                                                                                           |             |     |                       | Children eating lead-paint or water   |
| Overt or occult blood loss (peptic ulcer, colon cancer)                                                                                                          |             |     |                       |   Diagnosis: serum lead level • ≥ 5 mcg/dL = elevated blood lead level                                    |
| Malabsorption e.g. celiac or PPI (Fe2+ is easier to absorb than Fe3+, so Vitamin C deficiency reduces absoprtion)                                                                                                                                                                 |             |     |                       |                                       |

### *Questions to ask*
- "*Any significant bleeding in recent days? Menorrhagia for women?"
- *"Any GIT bleeding including melena / bloody stools?"*
- *"Any changes to diet?"*

# Management
## Treatments
**Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia**
-   Identify and treat the underlying cause
	- Stop GIT bleeding
	- Control menorrhagia
- Supplement dietary intake – iron deficiency anaemia responds very well to oral supplementation
	- SEs:
		- Constipation, diarrhoea, N/V, epigastric pain
		- Black/green/tarry stools
-   Iron infusion – for severe anaemia, or people with malabsoprtion syndromes
	- ==INDICATION is Hb<70 == 
	- ==INDICATION is SYMPTOMATIC ANAEMIA==

**Others**
- Treatment for sideroblastic - B6 supplementation
- Treatment for lead poisoning - remove exposure +/- chelation
- Treatment for thalassemia:
	- Blood transfusions
	- Splenectomy
	- Bone marrow transplantation
	- Iron chelation (if suspected iron overload)
	- Folate supplementation (for B thalassemia major)
