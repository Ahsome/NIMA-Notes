# Information
 
Anaemia is a condition of low RBC and oxygen-carrying capacity which causes symptoms of faitgue and weakness. 

**Megaloblastic anaemia is a subtype of macrocytic anaemia:**
- Impaired cell division in bone marrow producing large RBC precursors (e.g. hypersegmented neutrophils)
- Vitamin B12 deficiency 
	- Required for myelination of nerve fibers 
	- Deficiency: slowly-progressive neuropathy 
	- Neuropsychiatric changes 
		- Depression 
		- Irritability 
		- Cognitive decline
	- Gastric parietal cells → intrinsic factor (IF) 
		- IF binds B12 → absorbed in ileum
		- **==Pernicious anaemia==** - autoimmune condition where antibodies against IF or parietal cells
- Folate deficiency
	- Absorbed in the jejunum
	- Found in leafy vegetables, water soluble
- Vitamin B12 and folate are needed for DNA synthesis

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Typically asymptomatic but symptoms include:
1. Weakness
2. Fatigue 
3. Dyspnoea
4. Palm crease pallour, nail bed palllour, conjunctival pallour 
5. B12 deficiency - Neuropsychiatric changes 
	- Depression 
	- Irritability 
	- Cognitive decline
	- Weakness, ataxia, numbness and paresthesias
	- Ataxic gait + positive Romberg's sign


### *Risk factors*:

***Risk factors for folate deficiency***

| Malnutrition                      | Increased Use      | Malabsoprtion          | Drugs |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Requires severely restricted diet | Pregnancy          | Gastric bypass surgery | Methotrexate - Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase      |
| Heavy EtOH consumption            | Chronic haemolysis | Celiac disease         |    Abx e.g. Trimethoprim   |
| Anorexia                          |                    |                        |  Antiepileptics - cabamezapine, valproate, phenytoin     |


***Risk Factors for B12 deficiency:***
- Pernicious Anaemia
- Gastric bypass surgery
- Ileum resection / dysfunction - Crohn's disease
- Vegetarian (no meat consumption)

***Heavy alcohol consumption*** 
- Common cause of macrocytosis 
- Acetaldehyde may induce membrane changes in RBCs 
- Also causes resistant hypertension

***Myeolodysplastic syndromes also result in larger RBCs***

## Investigations
| Folate deficiency             | B12 deficiency                               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Low folate: less than 2 ng/mL | Low B12: less than 200 pg/mL                 |
|                               | Elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid |

# Management
***General treatment principles***
- Folate supplementation
- B12 supplementation
- Alcohol reduction
