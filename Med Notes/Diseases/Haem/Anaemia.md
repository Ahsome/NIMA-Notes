# Information
 
Anaemia is a condition of low RBC and oxygen-carrying capacity which causes symptoms of faitgue and weakness.

## Pathophysiology
![[Pasted image 20230509100344.png]]

--- 
# Scenario

2/7 days of dyspnoea, eercise tolerance < 20m (decreased from at least 100m). No fever, no resp symptoms. Has intermittent diarrhoea for a few days --> septic and anaemic.



# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Typically asymptomatic but symptoms include:
1. Weakness
2. Fatigue 
3. Dyspnoea
4. Palm crease pallour, nail bed palllour, conjunctival pallour 


---

## Examination findings
- Low BP
- Weak pulses
- Pallor of hands, face, conjunctiva, tongue
- Murke's lines on nails 
- Splenomegaly?

---

## Investigations

- FBC - Hb, WCC, ESR/CRP, platelets, MCV
- Coags study
- U & Es, LFTs
- Bun-Creating ratio - elevated in UGIB
- Stool MCS - infective cause e.g. C.diff
- FOBT / calprotectin --> CRC, IBD
- Upper endoscope or colonoscope for UGIB/LGIB
- NG aspirate - blood could indicate UGIB
- Eplorative laparotomy?

# Management
## Initial Acute Management
1. ABCDE
2. 2 large bore IV - fluids or blood
3. G + H
4. IV PPI (if unsure of cause / UGIB suspected)
5. Monitor Hb and Coags panel
6. Treatment based on cause 
7. Surgery if haemodynamically unstable / severe intitial/ongoing bleeding


## Longer term Mx
1. Monitor Hb and coags
2. Reduce risk of recurrent bleeds e.g. nitrates
3. Oral PPI if PUD, GORD, H.pylori
4. Iron supplements
5. Folate / B12 supplements
