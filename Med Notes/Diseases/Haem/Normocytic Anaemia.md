# Information
 
Anaemia is a condition of low RBC and oxygen-carrying capacity which causes symptoms of faitgue and weakness. 

Normocytic anaemia is broken up into 2 major branches of aetiologies, based on the kinetics of reduced production and increased production. This is observed through peripheral reticulocyte levels.

### LOW RETICULOCYTES
-   Bone marrow failure  
	- Aplastic anaemia
-   Leukaemia – results in bone marrow suppression due to the overload of blast cells
-   Anaemia of CKD – decreased production of EPO. Normal RBCs are produced, but just not as many due to reduced EPO.


### HIGH RETICULOCYTES
-   Acute haemorrhage
-   Haemolytic anaemia
	- Sickle cell disease  
	- Thalassaemia?  
	- Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia  
	- Mechanical heart valve/critical aortic stenosis  
	- Hypersplenism  
	- Cirrhosis (RBC being sliced as they go through a fibrosed liver)

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Typically asymptomatic but symptoms include:
1. Weakness
2. Fatigue 
3. Dyspnoea
4. Palm crease pallour, nail bed palllour, conjunctival pallour 
5. Pica (craving non-food substances e.g. clay/dirt)
6. Restless leg syndrome
7. Lead poisoning: abdo pain, anorexia, confusion, behavioural changes, poor concentration

### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
| Haemolysis                                      | Thalassemia                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| G6PD Deficiency                                 | reduced production of either the a or b chain globin, hence resulting in faulty haemoglobin molecules |
| Mechanical stress - AS, mechanical heart valves |                                                                                                       |
| Lupus                                           |                                                                                                       |
| Leukemia / Lymphoma                             |                                                                                                       |

### *Questions to ask*
- "*Any significant bleeding in recent days? Menorrhagia for women?"
- *"Any GIT bleeding including melena / bloody stools?"*

# Management
## Treatments
Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia
-   Identify and treat the underlying cause
	- Stop GIT bleeding
	- Control menorrhagia
- Supplement dietary intake – iron deficiency anaemia responds very well to oral supplementation
	- SEs:
		- Constipation, diarrhoea, N/V, epigastric pain
		- Black/green/tarry stools
-   Iron infusion – for severe anaemia, or people with malabsoprtion syndromes
	- ==INDICATION is Hb<70 == 
	- ==INDICATION is SYMPTOMATIC ANAEMIA==
- Treatment for sideroblastic - B6 supplementation
- Treatment for lead poisoning - remove exposure +/- chelation




---

# Complications
1. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
2. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)  
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
4. Severe hypertension 
5. Preeclampsia/HELLP
