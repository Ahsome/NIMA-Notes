# Information
 
Anaemia is a condition of low RBC and oxygen-carrying capacity which causes symptoms of faitgue and weakness. 

Normocytic anaemia is broken up into 2 major branches of aetiologies, based on the kinetics of reduced production and increased production. This is observed through peripheral reticulocyte levels.

### LOW RETICULOCYTES
-   Bone marrow failure  
	- Aplastic anaemia
-   Leukaemia – results in bone marrow suppression due to the overload of blast cells
-   Anaemia of CKD – decreased production of EPO. Normal RBCs are produced, but just not as many due to reduced EPO.


### HIGH RETICULOCYTES
-   Acute haemorrhage
-   Haemolytic anaemia
	- Sickle cell disease  
		- One abnormal gene: sickle cell trait (SA)
		- Two abnormal genes: sickle cells disease (SS)
	- Thalassaemia?  
	- Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia  
	- Mechanical heart valve/critical aortic stenosis  
	- Hypersplenism  
	- Cirrhosis (RBC being sliced as they go through a fibrosed liver)

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Typically asymptomatic but symptoms include:
1. Weakness
2. Fatigue 
3. Dyspnoea
4. Palm crease pallour, nail bed palllour, conjunctival pallour 
5. Splenomegaly
6. Sickle cell - acute pain crises, splenic sequestration, swollen hands (“dactylitis”)


### *Risk factors*:

# Management
***General treatment principles***
- Blood transfusions
- Remove instigating factor (e.g. treat underlying chronic disease or CKD)
- Folate supplementation
- Splenectomy if there is risk of etravascular sequestration of RBCs and splenomegaly 

**Treatment for hereditary spherocytosis:**
- Iron/bllood transfusions as needed
- Folate supplementation
- ==Splenectomy!!!==



---

# Complications
1. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
2. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)  
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
4. Severe hypertension 
5. Preeclampsia/HELLP
