# Information
 
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency requiring specialist care, and should generally be managed in hospital. DKA is characterised by dehydration, hyperglycaemia, polyuria, polydipsia and tachypnoea. 

DKA occurs mainly in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, it is also seen in patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly patients taking sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, when DKA may occur without hyperglycaemia.


**DKA diagnostic criteria:**
-  ==Hyperglycaemia – BGL > 11mmol/L== (BUT CAN BE NORMAL)
-   ==Metabolic acidosis – venous pH <7.3
	- ==Bicarb < 15mmol/L==
-   ==Ketosis – presence in blood or urine
	- ==Anion gap > 12mmol/L==

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
- Metabolic acidosis
- Hyperglycaemia - polyuria, polydipsia and tachypnoea
- Dehydration 
- Electrolyte disturbances/losses.
- Nausea and vomiting with ABDOMINAL PAIN – can often be misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis due to focal pain.
- Changes in mental state (confusion and drowsiness) – can cause reduced GCS, patients appearing lethargic and eventually obtunded. This is a BAD sign because it means there is impending cerebral injury.
- Fruity breath


### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
- T1DM, but also T2DM
- Not taking insulin
- Gastroenteritis 
- MI
- Trauma

### *Questions to ask*
>*"What is your usual total daily insulin dose, if applicable"
>"Any precipitating factors?"

***Electrolyte disturbance in DKA***
-   ==**Hyponatraemia**== – hyperglycaemia causes an increased osmotic drag of water from the intracellular compartment into the intravascular compartment, so hyponatraemia results from dilution.
-   ==**Hyperkalaemia**== – in acidosis, H+ is shifted into the cells, and K+ is shifted out, so resulting in a hyperkalaemia. Potassium must be monitored closely.

***Also consider:***
- CXR (rule out pneumonia)
- WCC - rule out infection
- ECG - hyperkalaemia 
- Blood culture if febrile
- Wound swab if diabetic foot ulcer

# Management
## Treatments
#### *Management*:
1. 2 IV cannulas
2. One arm - **Fluid resuscitation** – IV isotonic saline (0.9%) infusion. Solves the hypovolaemia and will solve the hyponatremia too.  
	- Consider ==bicarbonate infusion== – helps resolve acidosis. Threshold is pH < 6.8
3. Other arm - **Insulin infusion** to correct the hyperglycamia
4. **Correction of electolyte disturbances**  
	- ==K+ supplementation (esp < 3)== – insulin will not only shunt glucose into the cells, but also take potassium with it. Patients end up being hypokalemic, which is dangerous due to cardiac arrhythmias.
5. For patients taking a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 **(SGLT2) inhibitor**, stop the drug immediately
6. **Maintain airway** - consider an **NGT** if risk of aspiration
7. Septic screen (WCC, lactate, CRP, blood cultures, CXR, urine dipstick)
8. DVT prophylaxis 

### *Long-term issue*
Steps for managing long-term:
1. Education on precipitating factors
2. Diabetes educator
3. Micro and macrovascular complications of T2DM
