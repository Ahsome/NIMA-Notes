# Information
Diabetic Complications can be divided into macrovascular and microvascular complications. These complications increase the risk of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients and worsen their QoL.


# Macrovascular

# Diabetic foot ulcers: 
- Loss of sensation --> tissue damage
- Vascular disease --> inpaired healing
- May be painless
- Annual foot exam and sensory testing 
	- Monofillament (pressure)
	- Vibration
	- Pinprick
	- Ankle refleces
- Tx: 
	- SNRIs: duloxetine
	- TCAs: amitripyline
	- AEDs: pregabalin or gabapentin
