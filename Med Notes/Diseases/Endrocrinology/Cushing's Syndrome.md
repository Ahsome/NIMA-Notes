# Information
Cushing Syndrome is a clinical syndrome of excess effects of cortisol (synthesised by the adrenal glands). Most common cause: exogenous glucocorticoids (prednisone).

Cushing's DISEASE = overproduction of ACTH by pituitary
- Also caused by actopic ACTH from a neuroendocrine tumour
- Adrenal adenoma 

***Major effects:***
- Immunosuppression - reduces T and B lymphocyte levels by sequestering them in the spleen
- Hyperglycaemia - increases gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance
- HTN
- Fat deposition - stimulates adipocyte growth
- Muscle, bone and skin changes
- Reproductive effects - suppresses GnRH from pituitary - irregular menses or low testosterone 

***Pituitary-Adrenal Axis***

==Can be caused by [[Lung cancer#^e2b308|Paraneoplastic Syndromes from Small-cell Lung Cancer]]==

# History
### Symptoms
- Weight gain
- HTN, hyperglycaemia
- Fat deposition - moon face, buffalo hump, increased fat on trunk
- Muscle atrophy - weakness
- Thin arms and legs
- Thin skin prone to easy bruiding
- Osteopenia and osteoporosis (inhibits osteoblasts) 
- Menstrual irregularities
- Bruising and stria on abdomen
- Acne / hirsutism (hair on face) in cases of excess androgen production 
- Skin hyperpigmentation - only in ACTH-dependant Cushing's syndrome (due to increased MSH)

### Risk factors:
- Exogenous prednisone 
- ==Can be caused by [[Lung cancer#^e2b308|Paraneoplastic Syndromes from Small-cell Lung Cancer]]==
- Carcinoid tumours of the lung
- Islet celll tumours of pancreas
- Medullary thyroid carcinoma
- Thymus gland tumours
- Treatment: surgical resection of tumour 

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you take any steroid tablets?"* - rule out exogenous glucocorticoids
>*"Do you have any cancer?"*

## Investigations
| Key Tests                               | Result   | Explanation   |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 24-hour unirary cortisol excretion      |  |  |
| Late-night salivary cortisol            |          |               |
| Late-night serum cortisol               |          |               |
| Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test |Cushing's syndrome - cortisol will still be high and will not be suppressed|1mg dexamethason administered at bedtime, which should suppress normal pituitary ACTH release, and should have low cortisol level in the morning|
|Plasma ACTH level|          |               |

Cortisol increases and decreases through the day, should be highest in the morning, and lowest in the night.

# Management
Management of Cushing's
- Surgical resection of adrenal adenoma or tumour causing excess cortisol
- Reduce steroid dosage 
- Pharmacological blockage is last line if surgery is unsuccessful - using a dopamine agonist (**Cabergoline**)

## Management of obesity / weight gain
