Treatment needs to be evidence based and focused on a broad range of health outcomes, not simply on weight. Excellent management of medical, psychological and physical co-morbidity are critical to engaging patients in weight loss interventions, improving function and quality-of-life, and reducing morbidity and mortality. It is also important to note that not all methods to treat obesity are equally effective.


# Management of weight:
## 1. GP appointments:
- Routinely assess and monitor BMI and waist circumference
- Screen for and manage comorbidities
- Blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glucose, liver function tests, and ask about symptoms of sleep apnoea and depression
- Consistent follow-up and goal-setting is shown to be important for effective long term management of weight

## 2. Reduction of energy intake in line with Australian Dietary Guidelines

## 3. Focus on more physical activity (even incidental e.g. taking the staris instead of the lift), and less sedentary behaviour

## 4. Assist in setting up weight loss program:
-  Based on comorbidities, risk factors and weight history, consider adding intensive weight loss interventions (eg. VLEDs (very low energy diet(<800 kcal/day)), pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery)
-   Tailor the approach to the individual
-   Refer to **multidisciplinary team** for specialist treatment recommendations. Suitable patients include those with severe complex obesity for example those with a BMI >40, BMI >35 with any serious comorbidity, and those BMI 30â€“35 with serious comorbidity and a positive weight trajectory.

## 5. Pharmacotherapy
Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventiosn first, then consider medications
e.g. If patientis diabetic, consider: SGLT-2 inhibitor (esp for CVD or renal risk factors) and GLP1 Inhibitor.

## 6. Bariatric Surgery
Bariatric surgery should be considered for patients with a BMI >40 or with a BMI >35 with obesity related comorbidities. The three most commonly performed procedures in Australia include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG).

# Complications
1. Worsening of comorbidities
2. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome:
	- Reduced respiratory rate due to obesity and weight of anterior chest in ventillating 
	- cyanosis or plethora
	- right heart failure or biventricular heart failure
	- excessive daytime sleepiness
