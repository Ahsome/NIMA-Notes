# Information
 
**Diabetes Mellitus** is a chronic disorder of **elevated blood glucose** levels. It can be either caused by a *lack of insulin*, also called [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]], or a *lack of response to insulin*, called [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]]. It has many known **long-term complications**, from vascular, kidney, neuropathic, and blindness. It is often called the *"Silent Killer"*, due to a lack of symptoms until complications

> [!Important]
- [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*]] has a bimodal distribution in **children**, peaking at 4-6yo and 10-14yo ^a5d260
- [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] commonly affects adults with insidous onset. It is more dependant on **family history** and **obesity** ^6386e4
- Diagnosis cannot occur when patient is in illness or stress, as these increase cortisol and adrenaline, which in turn increases glucose levels. See [[Glossary#^8fbeef|Stress hyperglycemia]] ^b59224

## Pathophysiology
### Type I DM
Type I DM is an autoimmune disorder from a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. It comes from immune-mediated destrution of the beta cells of the pancreas, and results in the loss of insulin. It has a multifactorial etiology (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Risk factors:]])

It commonly affects **children**, and has a bimodial distribution:
1. First peak: 4-6 years
2. Second peak: 10-14 yeas

### Type II DM
Type II DM is a complex disorder of **insulin resistance**. This leads to hyperlgycemia. Initially, the pancreas responds with increasing insulin levels, but eventually fails. Family history has a strong effect, with Type II DM having a higher genetic component than Type I DM (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Risk factors]])

It commonly affects **adults**, but rates in children have been rising

### Gestational DM
Diabetes on the onset of gestation. Commonly diagnosed through the use of [[Glossary#^089fdb|OGTT]] rather than fasting glucose and A1c given expected insulin resistance in pregnancy. See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Investigations]]

### Mature Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY)
MODY is a rare form of diabetes due to >3 **changes in genes** disruting insulin production. While [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I:]] and [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] have multifactorial aetiologies, MODY comes from a single change in gene.

It commonly affects **children**

# Management
## Treatments
### *Possible drugs:*
1. Drug/Drug class 1
	1. Info on drug 1
2. Drug/Drug class 2
	1. Info on drug 2

---

### *Acute issue*
See  [[Diabetes Mellitus#Complications]] for information regarding [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Diabetic Ketoacidosis*:]]

---

### *Long-term management*:
#### *Treatment goals:*
Treatment goals target lowering of HbA1c, as that exemplifies better control of blood sugar:
1. [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]] target <7.0%
2. [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] target <7.0% for average adult, <8.0% for older patients
	1. The reason is you want to ***avoid hypoglycemia***, which causes more acute issues. Chronic issues of hyperglycemia is less important with limited life expectancy

#### *Monitoring*

#### *Type 1 DM management*
##### Summary:
[[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*]] involves the use of insulin to recover what the patient cannot produce. This is commonly done in three main ways:
1. Bolus-Basal: Where you have a *basal* insulin level that maintains throughout the day, and a *bolus* level that occurs before a meal. See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Bolus-Basal]] for specifics of treatment
2. [[Glossary#^ce5892|CSII]] (Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion): It uses an external battery-driven pump, containing an insulin reservoir to deliver rapid-acting insulin at a basal rate via a subcutaneous cannula, and the user initiates delivery of bolus doses immediately before meals
3. Mixed insulin: A mixture of rapid- or short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin is usually given twice daily

##### Bolus-Basal
A typical regiment includes:
1. Bolus: Long-acting insulin subcutaneously, OD/BD. It provides 40% of total daily insulin
| Drug     | Speed        | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Detemir  | Long-acting  | 16-24hr  |
| Glargine | Long-acting- | 24-36hr  |
| Isophane | Intermediate | 18hr     |  |
2. Basal: Rapid-acting insulin subcut, up-to 15 minutes before food. It provides 60% of total daily insulin
	1. Can substitute for short-acting, up-to 30 minutes before food.
| Drug     | Speed        | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Gluisine | Rapid-acting | 3-5hr    |
| Lispro   | Rapid-acting | 3-4.75hr |
| Aspart   | Rapid-acting | 3-5hr    |
| Neutral  | Short-acting | 6.5hr         |

##### Lifestyle
Lifestyle modifications that can be recommended include:
1. Improve dietary intake
2. Physical activity, >150 minutes a week

##### Screening
There is **no commonly accepted** method for screening for [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]]

---
#### *Type 2 DM management*
##### Summary:
[[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] involves maintaining a **healthy weight** and **exercise**. In some patients, this can be done *prior* to medical therapy, wit a 3-6 month trial.

If not, oral drugs such as **metformin** are used, escalating to insulin if:
1. Cannot achieve target A1c, even after addditional agents to metform
2. Severely elavated initial A1c (>9.5%)

Lastly, **bariatric surgery** can be done for obese patients (BMI >35). This leads to:
1. Long-term remission
2. Reduced risk of diabetes complications

##### Lifestyle
Lifestyle modifications that can be recommended include:
1. Improve dietary intake
2. Physical activity, >150 minutes a week

##### Screening
There is **no commonly accepted** method for screening for [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]]
