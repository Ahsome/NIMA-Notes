# Information
 
**Diabetes Mellitus** is a chronic disorder of **elevated blood glucose** levels. It can be either caused by a *lack of insulin*, also called [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]], or a *lack of response to insulin*, called [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]]. It has many known **long-term complications**, from vascular, kidney, neuropathic, and blindness. It is often called the *"Silent Killer"*, due to a lack of symptoms until complications

> [!Important]
- [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*]] has a bimodal distribution in **children**, peaking at 4-6yo and 10-14yo ^a5d260
- [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] commonly affects adults with insidous onset. It is more dependant on **family history** and **obesity** ^6386e4
- Diagnosis cannot occur when patient is in illness or stress, as these increase cortisol and adrenaline, which in turn increases glucose levels. See [[Glossary#^8fbeef|Stress hyperglycemia]] ^b59224
- Calculating eGFR and Alb/Cr ratio from urine dipstick (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Investigations]]) is critical for identifying [[Diabetes Mellitus#^cae015\|Diabetic Nepropathy]]. See [[Diabetes Mellitus#^cae015\|Diabetic Nepropathy]] for how to calculate risk of [[Chronic Kidney Disease]] ^65f830
- Add a SGLT-2 for diabetic patients with [[Coronary Artery Disease]], it has a protective effect ^da509f

## Type I DM
Type I DM is an autoimmune disorder from a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. It comes from immune-mediated destrution of the beta cells of the pancreas, and results in the loss of insulin. It has a multifactorial etiology (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Risk factors:]])

It commonly affects **children**, and has a bimodial distribution:
1. First peak: 4-6 years
2. Second peak: 10-14 yeas

## Type II DM
Type II DM is a complex disorder of **insulin resistance**. This leads to hyperlgycemia. Initially, the pancreas responds with increasing insulin levels, but eventually fails. Family history has a strong effect, with Type II DM having a higher genetic component than Type I DM (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Risk factors]])

It commonly affects **adults**, but rates in children have been rising

## Type IIIc (Exocrine Pancreas)
Loss of alpha + beta cells means loss of protective function of glucagon --> will not develop DKA but difficult to manage (risk of hypos) (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#^14928e|Type IIIc Risk Factors]])

Pancreatic cancer: need to consider in person >60yo with new onset diabetes (especially if insulin requiring or other red flag symptoms)

## Gestational DM
Diabetes on the onset of gestation. Commonly diagnosed through the use of [[Glossary#^089fdb|OGTT]] rather than fasting glucose and A1c given expected insulin resistance in pregnancy. See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Investigations]]

### Mature Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY)
MODY is a rare form of diabetes due to >3 **changes in genes** disruting insulin production. While [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I:]] and [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] have multifactorial aetiologies, MODY comes from a single change in gene.

It commonly affects **children**

## Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)
Immune-mediated: slowly progressive form of autoimmune diabetes (some argue T1DM caught early). May be misdiagnosed at [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]]

Defined by:
- Adult onset (>30)
- Autoantibody + (e.g. GAD)
- Not requiring insulin at diagnosis (>6months without insulin requirement)

# Management
## Treatments
---

### *Acute issue*
The following steps should be conducted:
1. Relieve symptoms of **hyperglycemia**, such as with Insulin, but avoid **hypoglycemia**
2. Avoid acute complications of **hyperglycemia**. See  [[Diabetes Mellitus#Complications]] for information, such as [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Diabetic Ketoacidosis*:]]

---

### *Long-term management*:
#### Overal:
1. Treatment goals target lowering of HbA1c, as that exemplifies better control of blood sugar:
	1. [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]] target <7.0%, between 5% to 10%
	2. [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] target <7.0% for average adult, <8.0% for older patients, between 5% to 10%
		1. The reason is you want to ***avoid hypoglycemia***, which causes more acute issues. Chronic issues of hyperglycemia is less important with limited life expectancy
2. Fingerprick monitoring should be conducted for treatments that have risk of hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylurea
3. BP control <140/90. Changes to <130/80 if albuminuria is present (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Risk of Chronic Kiney Disease :]]) ^90b089
	1. First line treatment is ACEi/ARB
4. Lipid management ^6f7958
	1. General targets:
		1. <4.0 Total Chol, <2.0 LDL
	2. Specific targets:
		1. CAD: LDL as low as possible, at least <1.8mmol/L
	3. Use high-intensity statin OR maximally tolerated

#### Type 1 DM management
##### Summary:
[[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*]] involves the use of insulin to recover what the patient cannot produce. This is commonly done in three main ways:
1. Bolus-Basal: Where you have a *basal* insulin level that maintains throughout the day, and a *bolus* level that occurs before a meal. See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Bolus-Basal]] for specifics of treatment
2. [[Glossary#^ce5892|CSII]] (Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion): It uses an external battery-driven pump, containing an insulin reservoir to deliver rapid-acting insulin at a basal rate via a subcutaneous cannula, and the user initiates delivery of bolus doses immediately before meals
3. Mixed insulin: A mixture of rapid- or short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin is usually given twice daily

##### Bolus-Basal
A typical regiment includes:
1. Bolus: Long-acting insulin subcutaneously, OD/BD. It provides 40% of total daily insulin
| Drug     | Speed        | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Detemir  | Long-acting  | 16-24hr  |
| Glargine | Long-acting- | 24-36hr  |
| Isophane | Intermediate | 18hr     |  |
2. Basal: Rapid-acting insulin subcut, up-to 15 minutes before food. It provides 60% of total daily insulin
	1. Can substitute for short-acting, up-to 30 minutes before food.
| Drug     | Speed        | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Gluisine | Rapid-acting | 3-5hr    |
| Lispro   | Rapid-acting | 3-4.75hr |
| Aspart   | Rapid-acting | 3-5hr    |
| Neutral  | Short-acting | 6.5hr         |

##### Lifestyle
Lifestyle modifications that can be recommended include:
1. Improve dietary intake
2. Physical activity, >150 minutes a week

##### Screening
There is **no commonly accepted** method for screening for [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]]

---
#### Type 2 DM management
##### Summary:
[[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] involves maintaining a **healthy weight** and **exercise**. In some patients, this can be done *prior* to medical therapy, wit a 3-6 month trial.

If not, oral drugs such as **metformin** are used, escalating to insulin if:
1. Cannot achieve target A1c, even after addditional agents to metform
2. Severely elavated initial A1c (>9.5%)

Lastly, **bariatric surgery** can be done for obese patients (BMI >35). This leads to:
1. Long-term remission
2. Reduced risk of diabetes complications

#### Pharmacological:
![[Pasted image 20230510144542.png]]
**Monotherapy** is first line, utilising [[Metformin]]. Dual or Multitherapy can be used based on patients profile. Should consider:
- Cardiovascular disease
- [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]
- Obesity
- Hypoglycemic Risk

Other options:
1. SGLT-2 inhibitor: Use if there is a of [[Coronary Artery Disease]], it has a protective effect and reduced morbidity
2. GLP1 Inhibitor: Useful for strong weight loss, helps with comorbidities

>[!Important]
>![[Diabetes Mellitus#^da509f]]

##### Lifestyle
Lifestyle modifications that can be recommended include:
1. Improve dietary intake
2. Physical activity, >150 minutes a week
3. Aim weight loss, 5-10%
4. Stop smoking, alcohol
	1. <= 2 standard drinks/day
	2. >= 2 alcohol free days/week

##### Screening
There is **no commonly accepted** method for screening for [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]]
