# Information
 
**Diabetes Mellitus** is a chronic disorder of **elevated blood glucose** levels. It can be either caused by a *lack of insulin*, also called [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*:]], or a *lack of response to insulin*, called [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type II DM*:]]. It has many known **long-term complications**, from vascular, kidney, neuropathic, and blindness. It is often called the *"Silent Killer"*, due to a lack of symptoms until complications

> [!Important]
- Diagnosis cannot occur when patient is in illness or stress, as these increase cortisol and adrenaline, which in turn increases glucose levels. See [[Glossary#^8fbeef|Stress hyperglycemia]] ^b59224

## Pathophysiology
### *Type I DM*:

### *Type II DM*:

## Investigations
### *Symptomatic*:
For patients with symptoms (polyuria, polydispia, DKA), the following test are performed:
| Key Tests | Result      | Explanation   |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Glucose   | >= 200mg/dl | Increased glucose levels due to not being controlled by insulin. |

| Additional Tests               |  Result   | Explanation                |

### *Asymptomatic*:
For patients who are asymptomatic, the follwoing tests are performed::

# Management
## Treatments
### *Possible drugs:*
1. Drug/Drug class 1
	1. Info on drug 1
2. Drug/Drug class 2
	1. Info on drug 2


### *Acute issue*
#### *Management*:
1. Steps for managing acutely

### *Long-term management*:
#### *Treatment goals:*
Treatment goals target lowering of HbA1c, as that exemplifies better control of blood sugar:
1. Type I DM target <7.0%
2. Type II DM target <7.0% for average adult, <8.0% for older patients
	1. The reason is you want to avoid hypoglycemia, which causes more acute issues. Chronic issues of hyperglycemia is less important with limited life expectancy


## Criteria
### *Insert test severity or score (e.g. Chad-Vacs)*
