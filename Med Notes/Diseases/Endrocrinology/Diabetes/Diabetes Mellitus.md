# Information
 
**Diabetes Mellitus** is a chronic disorder of **elevated blood glucose** levels. It can be either caused by a *lack of insulin*, also called [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*:]], or a *lack of response to insulin*, called [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type II DM*:]]. It has many known **long-term complications**, from vascular, kidney, neuropathic, and blindness. It is often called the *"Silent Killer"*, due to a lack of symptoms until complications

> [!Important]
- [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*]] has a bimodal distribution, peaking at 4-6yo and 10-14yo
- Diagnosis cannot occur when patient is in illness or stress, as these increase cortisol and adrenaline, which in turn increases glucose levels. See [[Glossary#^8fbeef|Stress hyperglycemia]] ^b59224

## Pathophysiology
### Type I DM
Type I DM is an autoimmune disorder from a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. It comes from immune-mediated destrution of the beta cells of the pancreas, and results in the loss of insulin. It has a multifactorial etiology (See [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Risk factors*:]])

It commonly affects **children**, and has a bimodial distribution:
1. First peak: 4-6 years
2. Second peak: 10-14 yeas

### Type II DM

### *Gestational DM*
Diabetes on the onset of gestation. Commonly diagnosed through the use of [[Glossary#^089fdb|OGTT]] rather than fasting glucose and A1c given expected insulin resistance in pregnancy. See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Investigations]]

## Investigations
### *Symptomatic*:
For patients with symptoms (polyuria, polydispia, DKA), the following test are performed:
| Key Tests | Result      | Explanation   |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Glucose   | >= 200mg/dl | Increased glucose levels due to not being controlled by insulin. |

| Additional Tests | Result           | Explanation   |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Urine dipstick   | Glucose in urine | Due to excretion from polydipsia |

### *Asymptomatic*:
For patients who are asymptomatic, the follwoing tests are performed::

# Management
## Treatments
### *Possible drugs:*
1. Drug/Drug class 1
	1. Info on drug 1
2. Drug/Drug class 2
	1. Info on drug 2


### *Acute issue*
See  [[Diabetes Mellitus#Complications]] for information regarding [[Diabetes Mellitus#*Diabetic Ketoacidosis*:]]

---

### *Long-term management*:
#### *Treatment goals:*
Treatment goals target lowering of HbA1c, as that exemplifies better control of blood sugar:
1. [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]] target <7.0%
2. [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type II DM]] target <7.0% for average adult, <8.0% for older patients
	1. The reason is you want to ***avoid hypoglycemia***, which causes more acute issues. Chronic issues of hyperglycemia is less important with limited life expectancy

#### *Type 1 DM management*
[[Diabetes Mellitus#*Type I DM*]] involves the use of insulin to recover what the patient cannot produce. This is commonly done in three main ways:
1. Bolus-Basal: Where you have a *basal* insulin level that maintains throughout the day, and a *bolus* level that occurs before a meal. See [[Diabetes Mellitus#Bolus-Basal]] for specifics of treatment
2. [[Glossary#^ce5892|CSII]] (Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion): It uses an external battery-driven pump, containing an insulin reservoir to deliver rapid-acting insulin at a basal rate via a subcutaneous cannula, and the user initiates delivery of bolus doses immediately before meals
3. Mixed insulin: A mixture of rapid- or short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin is usually given twice daily

##### Bolus-Basal
A typical regiment includes:
1. Bolus: Long-acting insulin subcutaneously, OD/BD. It provides 40% of total daily insulin
| Drug     | Speed        | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Detemir  | Long-acting  | 16-24hr  |
| Glargine | Long-acting- | 24-36hr  |
| Isophane | Intermediate | 18hr     |  |
2. Basal: Rapid-acting insulin subcut, up-to 15 minutes before food. It provides 60% of total daily insulin
	1. Can substitute for short-acting, up-to 30 minutes before food.

| Drug     | Speed        | Duration |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Gluisine | Rapid-acting | 3-5hr    |
| Lispro   | Rapid-acting | 3-4.         |

##### Lifestyle
Lifestyle modifications that can be recommended include:
1. Improve dietary intake
2. Physical activity, >150 minutes a week

##### Screening
There is **no commonly accepted** method for screening for [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type I DM]]
