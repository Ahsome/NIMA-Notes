# Information
 
HSS is a... 

> [!Important]
- Important point

## Pathophysiology
### *Variant (if applicable)*:

--- 
# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
- Hyperglycaemia - polyuria, polydipsia and tachypnoea
- Dehydration 
- Electrolyte disturbances/losses.
- Nausea and vomiting 
- Changes in mental state (confusion and drowsiness) 

### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
- T2DM
- Not taking insulin
- Gastroenteritis 
- MI
- Trauma

### *Questions to ask*
>*"What is your usual total daily insulin dose, if applicable"
>"Any precipitating factors?"

## Examination findings
| Key Findings  | Result    | Explanation                                                          |     |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Blood glucose | >33mmol/L | Combination of elevated glucose and extreme water loss through urine |     |
| Urine glucose    |    Elevated  |   Kidneys cannot absorb glucose and expels it out instead                                                                   |     |

## Investigations

- BGL and ketones
- VBG
- FBC
- U & E
- CRP
- Osmolality
- Septic screen (bllood culutres, CXR, urine dipstick)

# Management
## Treatments

### *Acute issue*
#### *Management*:
1. Admit to ICU - life-threatening
2. IV fluids - 0.9% NaCl 1L/hr
	- Flluid loss of 8-10L
3. K+ replacement
	- If K+ < 3.3, hold insulin + give 40meg/L K+ replacement
	-  If K+ > 3.3, can commence insulin
4. Investigate for precipitating event e.g. sepsis, CHF, RF, MI, stroke


### *Long-term issue*
1. Patient education e.g. BGL reading at home, know signs of hypos and HSS
2. Macrovasccular and microvascular complication management
3. Diabetic diet
4. Exercise
5. GP routine F/U for general monitoring and HbA1C
6. Optimise BP
7. Optimise CVS risk - statins, aspirin


## Differentials:
### DKA:
[[Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)]] and [[Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS)]] can both occur after management of diabetes:
| DKA                              | HHS                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Decreased PH                     | Normal PH                      |
| Increased glucose (13.9)         | Highly increased glucose (>33) |
| Increased serum ketones          | Normal serum ketones           |
| Variable serum Osml              | Increased Serum Osml (>320)    |
| Mental obtundation in **severe case** | Mental obtundation in **every case**                               |
