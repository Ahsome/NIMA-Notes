# SIRS
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a widespread inflammatory response that may or may not be associated with infection. The presence of two or more of the following criteria (one of which must be abnormal temperature or leukocyte count) defines SIRS

- Core temperature (measured by rectal, bladder, oral, or central probe) of >38.5°C or <36°C
- Tachycardia, defined as a mean heart rate more than two standard deviations above normal for age, or for children younger than one year of age, bradycardia defined as a mean heart rate <10th percentile for age
- Mean respiratory rate more than two standard deviations above normal for age or mechanical ventilation for an acute pulmonary process
- Leukocyte count elevated or depressed for age, or >10 percent immature neutrophils

>[!Important] SIRS criteria:
>- Body temperature > 38°C OR <36°C
>- HR > 100BPM
>- Tachypnoea > 20br
>- WBC > 12,000 or < 4,000 or 10% bands

# qSOFA 
Quick bedside score that is good for identifying patients who are septic and have end organ failure. It tells you the patients who are HIGH RISK. 2 of the following:

>[!Important] qSOFA criteria
>- Tachypnoea > 22br
>- Altered mentation, GCS < 14
>- Hypotension, SBP < 90mmHg
>- Blood lactate concentration more than 2 mmol/L


# Sepsis 
The systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the presence of suspected or proven infection constitutes sepsis. Several definitions further describe sepsis in terms of severity and response to therapy:

- **Severe sepsis** – Sepsis is considered severe when it is associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or dysfunction in two or more other organ systems as defined in the section on multiple organ failure below. 
- **Septic shock** – Septic shock refers to sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction (as described in the section on multiple organ failure below) that persists despite the administration of ≥40 mL/kg of isotonic fluid in one hour 
- **Refractory septic shock** – There are two types of refractory septic shock: fluid-refractory septic shock exists when cardiovascular dysfunction persists despite at least 40 to 60 mL/kg of fluid resuscitation, and catecholamine-resistant septic shock exists when shock persists despite therapy with dopamine ≥10 mcg/kg per minute and/or direct-acting catecholamines 
- **Multiple organ failure** – Reliably identifying and quantifying organ dysfunction is useful for tracking clinical changes and the response to therapy in children with septic shock. 
	- **Cardiovascular** – Hypotension, or reliance on a vasoactive drug to maintain blood pressure, or two of the following: metabolic acidosis, elevated arterial lactate, oliguria, or prolonged capillary refill.
	- **Respiratory** – Arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300, arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) >65 torr or 20 mmHg over baseline PaCO2, need for >50 percent FiO2 to maintain oxygen saturation ≥92 percent, or need for nonelective mechanical ventilation.
	- **Neurologic** – Glasgow coma score ≤11, or acute change in mental status.
	- **Hematologic** – Platelet count <80,000/microL or a decline of 50 percent from highest value recorded over the past three days or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a consumptive coagulopathy diagnosed by clinical findings of hemorrhage and microthrombi and laboratory abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, prolongation of clotting times (PT and aPTT), and evidence of fibrinolysis (low fibrinogen with elevated fibrin degradation products), which is a common hematologic manifestation in sepsis. 
	- **Renal** – Serum creatinine ≥2 times upper limit of normal for age or twofold increase in baseline creatinine.
	- **Hepatic** – Total bilirubin ≥4 mg/dL (not applicable to newborn) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2 times upper limit of normal for age.

# Management
## Acute Treatment
-   **==Fluid resuscitation==** – bolus saline to prevent end organ failure
	- If the patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation, give a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of at least 65 mmHg
- **==Measuring **blood lactate**==** concentration. If initial lactate concentration is more than 2 mmol/L, measure again within 2 to 4 hours
- Obtaining ==****blood samples** for culture. Collect two sets** ==(ie four bottles) from adults; a single smaller volume sample is appropriate for neonates and young children
	-   Collect blood samples – septic screen to identify organism and MCS
-   **Empiric antibiotic treatment**
	- Gentamycin IV (gram negative) 
	- Flucloxacillin IV (gram positive)
		- Replace with cefazolin/vancomycin if allergic
-   **Try and identify source of infection**
	- rapid specific treatment is essential (eg drainage of an abscess, removal of a vascular access device).


## Empirical regimens for adult with community-acquired sepsis
- **==Gentamicin==** **==4-5mg==** intravenously over 3 to 5 minutes
- PLUS **==flucloxacillin 2 g==** intravenously, 4-hourly
- PLUS **==vancomycin 25 to 30 mg/kg==** intravenously if MRSA or septic shock

## ## Empirical regimens for adult with hospital-acquired sepsis
- **==Piptaz 4.5g IV 6hr==** 
- PLUS **==vancomycin 25 to 30 mg/kg==** intravenously is MRSA or septic shock
- CONSIDER **==meropenem 1 g==** intravenously, 8-hourly if multi-drug-reistant Gram -ve bacteria INSTEAD of piptaz
