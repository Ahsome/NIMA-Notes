# Information
Dementia is a life-limiting, progressive syndrome characterised by cognitive and functional decline.

## Diagnosis of dementia
DSM V – major neurocognitive disorder
1. Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous baseline in one or more cognitive domains
2. Cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities
3. Deficits are not exclusively due to delirium
4. Not better explained by another mental disorder

## Types of dementia
1. Alzheimer’s disease
2. Vascular dementia
3. Lewy body dementia/Parkinson’s disease dementia
4. Fronto-temporal dementia
5.  Alcoholic dementia

# History
### Symptoms

### Risk factors:
- age > 65  
- air pollution (including second-hand smoke exposure)
-   hazardous alcohol consumption
-   depression
-   diabetes
-   poor education
-   head injury
-   hearing impairment
-   hypertension
-   obesity
-   physical inactivity
-   smoking
-   social isolation

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any ???"*

---

## Investigations
1.  CT, MRI, PET MRI
2.  FBC, CHEM20, B12, TFT, HIV, syphilis, ESR
3.  Screening tools – AMT, MMSE, MOCA, others
4.  Neuropsychology (MSE)

# Management
## Early management
1.  Advanced health directive - enduring power of attorney
2.  Will
3.  Statement of choices if lacking capacity
4.  Driving/gun and other licences
5.  Information for patient and carers
6.  ACAT assessment
7. Ensure patient is educated about their disease, and encourage services such as Dementia Australia for further support and services
8. Determine and address the patient's unmet needs 
	- Organise help with personal care 
	- Consider a full-time carer or transition to a nursing home 
9. Encourage patient to engage in activities that promote functional independence and incolce their familly, carers or significant others if possible 
10. De-prescribing anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, etc. - could be causing mental decline 
11. Create a multicomponent behavioural care plan that involves assessing potential triggers and optimising nonpharmacological interventions 
12. Promote general weelbeing - diet, hydration, dental and gum health, reduce alcohol intake, stop smoking, sleep well, socially active

## Pharmacological Management
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ie donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine (an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)) can modestly improve or stabilise symptoms of some types of dementia, but are not curative and do not delay disease progression. These drugs are only approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for Alzheimer dementia.

- MMSE <24
	- Generally, an indication for **==cholinesterase inhibitor; e.g. rivastigmine==** 1.5mg PO td for 2 weeks, then increase to 3mg PO td. May increase to 4.5mg and then 6mg based on tolerability, can be considered every 4 weeks.
	- Evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors is ==best for AD==, then for LBD
- MMSE <18
	- Memantine 5 mg PO od first week, 5 mg PO td second week, 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg at dinnertime in the third week, and then 10 mg twice daily.
- Can use antipsychotics (==risperidone==) for agitation, agrresion or psychosis in dementia
- Antidepressants (SSRIs) in dementia:
	- Escitalopram 10 mg orally, in the morning; maximum daily dose of 20 mg. For patients older than 65 years, use 5 mg orally, in the morning, maximum daily dose of 10 mg OR
	- ==Sertraline 50 mg orally==, in the morning; maximum daily dose of 200 mg
- The effects of aging on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic handling of drugs.
- Common drug dose adjustments in the elderly population, and the issue of polypharmacy
- Organization of community and residential care services for the elderly
- Work practices of a multidisciplinary clinical team
- Concepts of goal setting and discharge planning
- Care coordination in the elderly
