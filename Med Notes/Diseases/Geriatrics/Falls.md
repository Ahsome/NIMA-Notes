- Poor balance + mobility 

***Intrinsic factors:***

## Examination findings
| System  | Result                |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| MSK     | Abnormal gait         |
| CVS     | Postural hypotension  |
| Neuro   | Peripheral neuropathy |
| General | Look for injuries     |

## Investigations
| Key Tests               | Result                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ECG                     | Look for arrhythmias, any heartblocks, etc. |
| Bloods                  | FBC, Chem20, Vitamin D                      |
| X-ray of affected limbs | For fractures                               |
| CT brain                | Rule out bleeding                           |
| DEXA scan               | To check for osteoporosis                                            |


>[!Important]
>All individuals > 50yo who sustain a fracture following minimal trauma should be considered to have a presumptive Dx of osteoporosis
>- A T-score of -2.5 on a DEXA scan or lower means that you have [[osteoporosis]].

# Management
### *Acute issue*
1. Medication review - polypharmacy / meds that can cause postual drop
2. If fracture, manage it using a splint / immbolise and analgesia
3. Falls risk assessment
4. Treat osteoporosis 
	1. ==Bisphosphonates== - reduces osteoclasts
	2. ==Denosumab== - Inhibits RANKLL which stops development of osteoclasts 
	3. ==HRT== 

### *Long-term issue*
1. Fall prevention strategies
	- Falls bracelet
	- Exercise (e.g. Tai Chi)
	- Redication review
	- OT assessment of home 
	- Podiatry interventions
	- Hip protectors to prevent fractures if future falls 
	- Walking stick / 4-wheely walker
	- Optometrist to check-up on vision
1. Treatment for osteoporosis
	- Reduce risk - cease smoking, alcohol, med review
	- Weight bearing exercises
	- Good nutrition 
	- Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation
2. Physio assessment
	- Walking aids if needed 
	- OT assessment for home
3. GP for ongoing care

# Complications of falls
1. Injuries e.g. intracranial bleeds, common fracture sites:
	- Neck of femur
	- Wrist
	- Vertebral 
2. Aspiration
3. Pressure ulcers
4. Rhabdomyolysis
