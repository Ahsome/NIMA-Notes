# Information
Elderly 89 yo patient BIBA after being found by a stranger wandering the streets and is acutely confused.


## DSM-V definition of delirium
1. Disturbance in attention (reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention) and awareness
2.  The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days), represents a change from baseline, and tends to fluctuate during the course of a day
3.  An additional disturbance in cognition (memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception)
4.  The disturbances are not better explained by another pre-existing, evolving or established neurocognitive disorder, and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma
5.  There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is caused by a medical condition (e.g. UTI), substance intoxication or withdrawal, or medication side effect.

# History
### Risk factors:
Causes (which should be the focus of investigations)
1.  Fluid and electrolyte disturbances (dehydration, hyponatraemia, hypernatremia)
2.  Infections (UTI, LRTI, skin, soft tissue)
3.  Drug or alcohol toxicity
4.  Withdrawal from alcohol
5.  Withdrawal from barbiturates, BZD, SSRIs
6.  Metabolic disorders – hypoglycaemia, hypercalcemia, uremia, [[Liver Failure and Cirrhosis]], thyrotoxicosis
7.  Low perfusion states (shock, heart failure)
8.  Postoperative states, especially in the elderly.
9.  Less common – hypoxaemia, hypercarbia, Wernicke’s, adrenal failure, CNS, infection, seizures, trauma and paraneoplastic syndromes confusional states
10. Peri-operative - mostly hypoactive


## Questions to ask
- *"Is there anyone we can get a collateral history from"
- "*Any recent changes in medications?"*
- "*Any withdrawal from alcohol, or medications?"*
- "*Dehydration or low food intake?"*
- "*Past medical history? Diabetes, thyroid disorder, [[Liver Failure and Cirrhosis]], UTI, etc"**

## Investigations
|Key Findings| Result | Explanation                                |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| GCS          | Low    | Confusedd, disorientated                   |
| Electrolytes | ?      | Dehydration, hyponatraemia, hypernatraemia |
| FBC          | WCC    | Infection e.g. UTI                         |             |        |                                            |

# Management
## Prophylaxis/Prevention:
![[Pasted image 20230524202751.png]]
## Treatment
1. IV fluids and replace electrolyes
2. Treat infection is there is one 
3. Keep for observation and discharge with education
	- Patients with delirium can accidentally harm themselves by pulling out medical lines and tubes (eg endotracheal tubes, intravascular and urinary catheters)
	- If possible, remove these devices—this is usually more effective than trying to restrain the patient to avoid removal.
4. For patients who are delirious and are considered a threat to themselves or others (last resort):
	- haloperidol 0.5 mg orally, as a single dose OR
	- risperidone 0.5 mg orally, as a single dose
