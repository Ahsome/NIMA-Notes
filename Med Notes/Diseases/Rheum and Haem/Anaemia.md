# Information
 
Anaemia is a condition of low RBC and oxygen-carrying capacity which causes symptoms of faitgue and weakness.

## Pathophysiology
![[Pasted image 20230509100344.png]]
-   a and b thalassaemia – reduced production of either the a or b chain globin, hence resulting in faulty haemoglobin molecules.

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Typically asymptomatic but symptoms include:
1. Weakness
2. Fatigue 
3. Dyspnoea
4. Palm crease pallour, nail bed palllour, conjunctival pallour 

### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
| Microcytic iron-deficient anaemia | Normocytic Anaemia | Macrocytic Anaemia |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| - Menorrhagia (women of childbearing age)<br>- Reduced dietary intake<br>- Overt or occult blood loss (most commonly in GIT)  |        |                    |

### *Questions to ask*
- "*Any significant bleeding in recent days? Menorrhagia for women?"
- *"Any GIT bleeding including melena / bloody stools?"*

## Investigations

***Microcytic Anaemia***
- Blood smear – shows the actual morphology of the RBCs and neutrophils
	- Iron deficiency anaemia – hypochromic microcytic
- GIT bleeding?
	- Endoscopy, colonoscopy, capsule – cancer? Angioectasia? Peptic ulcer? H. pylori? Dieulafoy’s lesion? Is there an obvious source of bleeding?
	- ASK ABOUT MELENA? Haematemesis? PR bleeding?
-   Stool testing – faecal occult blood (FOB)
-   Coeliac disease screen – can be a cause of GIT bleeding and malabsorption.

# Management
## Treatments
Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia
-   Identify and treat the underlying cause
	- Stop GIT bleeding
	- Control menorrhagia
- Supplement dietary intake – iron deficiency anaemia responds very well to oral supplementation
-   Iron infusion – for severe anaemia.
	- ==INDICATION is Hb<70 == 
	- ==INDICATION is SYMPTOMATIC ANAEMIA==

## Criteria
### *Insert test severity or score (e.g. Chad-Vacs)*
