# Information
Parkinson's is a movement disorder due to **loss of dopamine containing neurons** in te *substantia nigra of the basal ganglia* (midbrain)
1. Leads to reduced excitatory input to motor cortex

It is a clinical diagnosis, based on classical features:
1. Bradykinesia: Occurs in 80% of patients
2. Tremor
3. Rigidity

![[Pasted image 20230513231514.png]]

If not exhibited, then ***consider other alternativ diagnosis***
If not responding to treatment, ***then consider other alternative diagnosis***

Can have loss of autonomic nervous system, leading to **orthostatic hypotension**:
1. Occurs in 20% to 60%
2. More common with levodopa treatment

### Temor-DOminant Parkinson's:
Has symptoms of tremor, but *no significant bradykinesia or gait problems*
Better prognosis than other forms of Parkinson's

> [!Important]
- No imaging or blood test
- Consider other diagnosis if three classical features aren't present, or not responding to treatment

# History
### Symptoms
Classic features:
![[Pasted image 20230513231520.png]]
**Bradykinesia:**
1. Generalised slowness of movement
2. *Shuffling of steps*
3. Unsteadiness

Other symptoms:
1. Masked facial expression (Lack of movement)
2. Shuffling gait
	1. Narrow based
	2. Short steps
	3. Freezing
3. Dementia (late)

### Risk factors:
1. Older age
2. Family history
3. Smoking (PROTECTIVE)

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any ???"*

# Investigation
## Drug management

| Test | Explanation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| LFTs | Used to monitor due to Tolcapone's liver toxicity. See [[#Treatment:]]            |

---

# Management
## Overall management:
Treatment management involves:
1. Increase dopaine activity
2. Block ACh activity
3. Treatments include:
	1. MAO type-B inhibitors
	2. COMT inhibitors
	3. Dopamine agnost
4. Consider [[#Side Effects:]]

### Side Effects:
**Dopamine drugs**:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Excessive sleepiness
- Dyskinesia
- COnfusion and hallucinations

## Treatment:
Overall treatment:
- Levodopa is the most effective medication for controlling the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease
	- Utilise with carbidopa, a  peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor
	- Can use benserazide
- COMT inhibitors can be used to prevent off-symptoms of Levodopa
	- Only use with Levodopa, useless by itself
	- Entacapone
	- Avoid Tolcapone due to liver toxicity
- Dopamine agonists: Used as monotherapy in early-stage disease or as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced disease  
	- Pramipexole
	- Ropinirole
- MAO-B inhibitors: early-stage disease or as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced disease
	- Selegiline
	- Rasagiline
- Anticholinergic used to control tremor in younger patients with Parkinson's disease who do not have significant cognitive impairment. **OR TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**
	- Trihexyphenidyl
	- Benztropine
- Extra: 
	- Amantadine: Used to control dyskinesias (involuntary movements) associated with levodopa therapy.**OR TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**
	-   Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery may be considered for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who have motor complications that are not well-controlled with medication.
- Patients with Parkinson's disease should be referred to a multidisciplinary team, which may include a neurologist, geriatrician, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, speech therapist, and social worker, to provide comprehensive care and support.

**Carbidopa-Levodopa**:
1. Levodopa crossess BBB, converted to dopamine in CNS by dopa ecarboxylase
	1. This aids
2. Limited benefit as peripheral decarboxylase breaks down L-dopa
	1. Also increases CVS side effects if broken down in periphery
	2. Use carbidopa to block peripheral decarboxylase
3. On-off phenomena:
	1. Can be dependent, depleting natural dopamine
	2. Levodopa has short half life, so high response initially due to no dopamine, crash after half life
	3. Symptoms:
		1. Off: Freezing or gait
		2. On: Dyskinesia, abnormal, involuntary movements
	4. Other side effects:
		1. Headache
		2. Nausea
		3. Sleepiness
		4. Dizzines
	5. Older patients (due to dopamine excess):
		1. Confusion
		2. Hallucinations
		3. Delusions

**COMT Inhibitor**:
1. Inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
	1. Enzyme that breaks down levodopa
	2. As such, only use in combination with levodop
	3. Boost to prevent off-effects of levodopa
		1. Entocapone: Peripheral
		2. Tolcapone: Peripheral, Central. Associate with liver toxicity so need LFT

**MOA-B** Inhibitor:
1. Inhibits monoamin oxidase type B
	1. Centrally breaks down dopamine, moreso than 5HT (MAO-A is more 5HT)
2. Inhibition increases central dopamine levels
3. Used alone or added to carbidopa-levodopa
4. Can cause serotonin syndrome, but rare

**Dopamine Agnosits**:
1. Used as monotherapy in early disease
2. Adverse effects similar to levodopa
3. Examples:
	1. Oral:
		1. Pramipexole
		2. Ropinirole
	2. Transdermal patch:
		1. Rotigotine

ACh receptor antagonist:
1. Speciiclaly, M1 muscurinic
2. Trihyexpheidyl and beztropine
3. Side effects: Sedation and dry mout
4. **USED IN TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**

Amantadine:
1. Antiviral drug
2. Has dopamine agonist, anticholinergic activity
3. **USED IN TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**
	1. Also mild Parkinson
