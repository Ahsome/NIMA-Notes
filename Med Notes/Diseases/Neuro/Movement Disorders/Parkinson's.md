# Information
Parkinson's is a movement disorder due to **loss of dopamine containing neurons** in te *substantia nigra of the basal ganglia* (midbrain)
1. Leads to reduced excitatory input to motor cortex

It is a clinical diagnosis, based on classical features:
1. Bradykinesia: Occurs in 80% of patients
2. Tremor
3. Rigidity

![[Pasted image 20230513231514.png]]

If not exhibited, then ***consider other alternativ diagnosis***
If not responding to treatment, ***then consider other alternative diagnosis***

Can have loss of autonomic nervous system, leading to **orthostatic hypotension**:
1. Occurs in 20% to 60%
2. More common with levodopa treatment

Has similar symptoms to [[Lewy Body Dementia]]:
1. However, dementia develops before or safe time as movement symptoms
2. In Parkinsons, dementia happens years after symptoms
3. Likely a continuum of same disorder

### Temor-Dominant Parkinson's:
Has symptoms of tremor, but *no significant bradykinesia or gait problems*
Better prognosis than other forms of Parkinson's



> [!Important]
1. Parkinson's is a movement disorder caused by a loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain.
2.  The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's is based on the classical features of bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity.
3.  If the classical features are not present or not responding to treatment, consider other alternative diagnoses.
4.  Parkinson's can lead to loss of the autonomic nervous system, which can cause orthostatic hypotension.
5.  Tremor-dominant Parkinson's has symptoms of tremor but no significant bradykinesia or gait problems and has a better prognosis than other forms of Parkinson's.
6.  There are no imaging or blood tests available to diagnose Parkinson's.
7.  The main treatment for Parkinson's involves increasing dopamine activity and blocking ACh activity.
8.  Treatments include Levodopa (the most effective medication for controlling the motor symptoms), COMT inhibitors (used to prevent off-symptoms of Levodopa), dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and anticholinergics.
9.  Patients with Parkinson's should be referred to a multidisciplinary team, including a neurologist, geriatrician, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, speech therapist, and social worker, to provide comprehensive care and support.
10.  Metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and antipsychotics should be avoided in Parkinson's treatment, while quetiapine is the antipsychotic with the least movement side effects.

# History
### Symptoms
Classic features:
![[Pasted image 20230513231520.png]]
**Bradykinesia:**
1. Generalised slowness of movement
2. *Shuffling of steps*
3. Unsteadiness

Other symptoms:
1. Masked facial expression (Lack of movement)
2. Shuffling gait
	1. Narrow based
	2. Short steps
	3. Freezing
3. Dementia (late)

### Risk factors:
1. Older age
2. Family history
3. Smoking (PROTECTIVE)

### Questions to ask

# Investigation
## Drug management

| Test | Explanation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| LFTs | Used to monitor due to Tolcapone's liver toxicity. See [[#Treatment:]]            |

# Management
## Overall management:
Treatment management involves:
1. Increase dopaine activity
2. Block ACh activity
3. Treatments include:
	1. MAO type-B inhibitors
	2. COMT inhibitors
	3. Dopamine agnost
4. Consider [[#Side Effects:]]

### Side Effects:
**Dopamine drugs**:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Excessive sleepiness
- Dyskinesia
- COnfusion and hallucinations

## Treatment:
### Overall treatment:
- Levodopa is the most effective medication for controlling the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease
	- Utilise with carbidopa, a  peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor
	- Can use benserazide
- COMT inhibitors can be used to prevent off-symptoms of Levodopa
	- Only use with Levodopa, useless by itself
	- Entacapone
	- Avoid Tolcapone due to liver toxicity
- Dopamine agonists: Used as monotherapy in early-stage disease or as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced disease  
	- Pramipexole
	- Ropinirole
- MAO-B inhibitors: early-stage disease or as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced disease
	- Selegiline
	- Rasagiline
- Anticholinergic used to control tremor in younger patients with Parkinson's disease who do not have significant cognitive impairment. **OR TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**
	- Trihexyphenidyl
	- Benztropine
- Extra: 
	- Amantadine: Used to control dyskinesias (involuntary movements) associated with levodopa therapy.**OR TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**
	-   Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery may be considered for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who have motor complications that are not well-controlled with medication.
		- Old surgeries include pallidotomy (partial ablation of globus pallidus) and thalamotomy (partial ablation of thalamus)
		- Part of basal ganglia
- Patients with Parkinson's disease should be referred to a multidisciplinary team, which may include a neurologist, geriatrician, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, speech therapist, and social worker, to provide comprehensive care and support.

#### Avoid:
1. Metoclopramide: Blocks dopamine
2. Prochloperazine: Blocks dopamine
3. Antipsychotics: Many blocks dopamine
	1. Least movement side effects: quetiapine

### Drug Summaru
**Carbidopa-Levodopa**:
1. Levodopa crossess BBB, converted to dopamine in CNS by dopa ecarboxylase
	1. This aids
2. Limited benefit as peripheral decarboxylase breaks down L-dopa
	1. Also increases CVS side effects if broken down in periphery
	2. Use carbidopa to block peripheral decarboxylase
3. On-off phenomena:
	1. Can be dependent, depleting natural dopamine
	2. Levodopa has short half life, so high response initially due to no dopamine, crash after half life
	3. Symptoms:
		1. Off: Freezing or gait
		2. On: Dyskinesia, abnormal, involuntary movements
	4. Other side effects:
		1. Headache
		2. Nausea
		3. Sleepiness
		4. Dizzines
	5. Older patients (due to dopamine excess):
		1. Confusion
		2. Hallucinations
		3. Delusions

**COMT Inhibitor**:
1. Inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
	1. Enzyme that breaks down levodopa
	2. As such, only use in combination with levodop
	3. Boost to prevent off-effects of levodopa
		1. Entocapone: Peripheral
		2. Tolcapone: Peripheral, Central. Associate with liver toxicity so need LFT

**MOA-B** Inhibitor:
1. Inhibits monoamin oxidase type B
	1. Centrally breaks down dopamine, moreso than 5HT (MAO-A is more 5HT)
2. Inhibition increases central dopamine levels
3. Used alone or added to carbidopa-levodopa
4. Can cause serotonin syndrome, but rare

**Dopamine Agnosits**:
1. Used as monotherapy in early disease
2. Adverse effects similar to levodopa
3. Examples:
	1. Oral:
		1. Pramipexole
		2. Ropinirole
	2. Transdermal patch:
		1. Rotigotine

ACh receptor antagonist:
1. Speciiclaly, M1 muscurinic
2. Trihyexpheidyl and beztropine
3. Side effects: Sedation and dry mout
4. **USED IN TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**

Amantadine:
1. Antiviral drug
2. Has dopamine agonist, anticholinergic activity
3. **USED IN TREMOR-DOMINANT PARKINSON**
	1. Also mild Parkinson
