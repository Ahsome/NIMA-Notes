# Information
Parkinson's is a movement disorder due to **loss of dopamine containing neurons** in te *substantia nigra of the basal ganglia* (midbrain)
1. Leads to reduced excitatory input to motor cortex

It is a clinical diagnosis, based on classical features:
1. Bradykinesia: Occurs in 80% of patients
2. Tremor
3. Rigidity

![[Pasted image 20230513231514.png]]

If not exhibited, then ***consider other alternativ diagnosis***
If not responding to treatment, ***then consider other alternative diagnosis***

Can have loss of autonomic nervous system, leading to **orthostatic hypotension**:
1. Occurs in 20% to 60%
2. More common with levodopa treatment

> [!Important]
- No imaging or blood test
- Consider other diagnosis if three classical features aren't present, or not responding to treatment

# History
### Symptoms
Classic features:
![[Pasted image 20230513231520.png]]
**Bradykinesia:**
1. Generalised slowness of movement
2. *Shuffling of steps*
3. Unsteadiness

Other symptoms:
1. Masked facial expression (Lack of movement)
2. Shuffling gait
	1. Narrow based
	2. Short steps
	3. Freezing
3. Dementia (late)

### Risk factors:
1. Older age
2. Family history
3. Smoking (PROTECTIVE)

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any ???"*

# Management
## Overall management:
Treatment management involves:
1. Increase dopaine activity
2. Block ACh activity
3. Treatments include:
	1. MAO type-B inhibitors
	2. COMT inhibitors
	3. Dopamine agnost

###

## Treatment:
ETG:
-   Levodopa is the most effective medication for controlling the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia.
-   Levodopa is usually given in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (such as carbidopa or benserazide) to prevent the breakdown of levodopa before it reaches the brain.
-   Dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) can be used as monotherapy in early-stage disease or as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced disease.
-   Monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors (such as selegiline or rasagiline) can be used as monotherapy in early-stage disease or as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced disease.
-   Anticholinergic medications (such as trihexyphenidyl) can be used to control tremor in younger patients with Parkinson's disease who do not have significant cognitive impairment.
-   Amantadine can be used to control dyskinesias (involuntary movements) associated with levodopa therapy.
-   Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery may be considered for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who have motor complications that are not well-controlled with medication.
-   Patients with Parkinson's disease should be referred to a multidisciplinary team, which may include a neurologist, geriatrician, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, speech therapist, and social worker, to provide comprehensive care and support.
