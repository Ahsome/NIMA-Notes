# Information
Seizures is a sudden alteration in behaviour due to transient CNS electrical acitivity in the cerebral cortex.

Most generalised seizures occur in childhood, whereas most focal seizures happen in adults secondary to a brain lesion.

Generallised epilepsy is a genetic condition

Epilepsy - multiple unprovoked seizures

> [!Important]
- It is important to get a history from patient, but also COLLATERAL history from bystanders and paramedics (esp. bc post-ictal often = confusion)

--- 
# History
### Symptoms
- Abnormal motor activity
- Abnormal sensation
- LOC
- Tongue biting
- Incontinence
- Peioral cyanosis (children)
- Aura
	- Simple, partial seizures 
	- Occipital lobe: flashing lights
	- Motor cortex: muscle jerking
- Post-ictal state: confusion, lack of alertness
	- Focal neurological deficits may be present
	- ==Key distinction from syncope==
- Most seizures are self-limited ~2mins

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tonic                    | sustained muscle tone                                       |
| Clonic                   | myoclonic muscle jerks                                      |
| Atonic                   | loss of muslce tone                                         |
| Simple                   | no alteration of consciousness                              |
| Complex                  | alteration of consciousness                                 |
| Partial                  | involves a discrete area of the brain - specific features   |
| Generalised              | entire brain affected (may begin as a partial seizure)      |
| Tonic-clonic (Grand mal) | unconsciousness, convulsions, muscle rigidity               |
| Absence (Petite mal)     | brief LOC                                                   |
| Post-ictal state         | Key distinction from syncope - confusion, lack of alertness |
|                          |                                                             |


### Risk factors:
- Fever (children)
- Lack of sleep
- Drugs, alcohol
- Hypoglycaemia
- Tumours
- Strokes
- Withdrawal - alcohol, benzos, barbituates, anticonvulsant drugs
- Marijuana esp. synthetitic cannabis is a procconvulsant
- Infection e.g. [[Encephalitis]] or [[Meningitis]]
- ==Neurocysterosis (parasites) from pork== - most common risk factor for seizures in Australia

### Questions to ask
>*"Do you notice any post-seizure symptoms ???"* - tongue-biting, incontinence
>*"Any aura?"*
>*"Did anyone observe your seizure?"* - get collateral hsitory from bystanders

| Key Tests         | Result                   | Explanation   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Blood             | Calcium, sodium, glucose | Electrolyte distrubances can cause seizures |
|^^| CBC                      |               |
|^^| Renal function           |               |

| Toxicology screen |  | Drug or alcohol use              |
| ECG               |                          | Cardiac syncopes can look a lot like a seizure              |
| CT or MRI brain   |  |  Brain tumours / haemorrhage              |
| Lumbar puncture  |                          |[[Encephalitis]]/ [[Meningitis]]|
| EEG                  |                          | Last investigation after all others come back negative              |

# Management
## Acute
1. Move bystanders and objects out of the way if someone is having a seizure
2. Loosen tight clothing around neck
3. Place on side to avoid aspiration
4. Seizure medications
	1. **Focal partial seizure = carbamezapine**
	2. *Generalised seizure = sodium valproate* 
	3. For absence seizures: Ethosuximide (calcium channel blocker)
	4. For status epilepticus: IV benzodiazepine (lorazepam)
	5. Drugs used in pregnancy: Levetiracetam or Lamotrigine
		- Many are teratogenic (esp. Valproic acid and carbamezapine)
		- High-dose folic acid supplementation is recommended for pregnant mothers who take seizure drugs (4mg/day)

>[!Danger]+ In Pregnancy
*In pregnancy*: **Avoid valproate and carbamezapine** as they cause *neural tube defects*

### Common drugs:
![[Pasted image 20230516055552.png]]
==*Levetiracetam = Keppra*==

### Side effects:
- Teratogenic (neural tube defects)
	- Drugs used in pregnancy:
	- Levetiracetam or Lamotrigine
- Steven-Johnson Syndrome (carbamezapine, phenytoin)
- Reduced bone density 
- Overdose - baributates e.g. phenobarbital 


# Status Epilepticus
[[Seizures and Status Epilepticus#^sljj9r|Status epilepticus]] is a life-threatening emergency

LIFE-THREATENING: Lactic acidosis, arrhythmias, HTN
Cortical laminar necrosis --> permanent neurological disease

## Defined by:

>[!Important] Defined by:
 > - 5 minutes of continuous seizures
>- OR > 2 seizures with incomplete recovery of consciousness 
>- OR continuous seizure > 30min

Usually occurs with generalised tonic-clonic activity

- Goal is to "break" seizure
1. ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation)
2. First-line treament: IV lorazepam 1mg (give until seizure "breaks")
	- these are short-acting
3. IV antiseizure: fosphenytoin, valproate, levetirecetam
4. If still seizing: phenobaribital
5. Often requires GA and intubation



## Long-term management
1. No driving for 6-12 months after unprovoked seizure 
2. Warn patients that abruptly stopping antiepileptic drugs can provoke status epilepticus
3. Psychology and drug abuse support services - frank conversations about risk factors 

---

# Complications
1. Status epilepticus is a life-threatening disease as it resuts in lactic acidosis, arrhythmias, HTN ^sljj9r
	1. Cortical laminar necrosis --> permanent neurological disease
2. Sodium valproate SEs - tremors
3. Vascular malformations - can cause [[Seizures and Status Epilepticus]] and [[Gastrointestinal Bleeding]]? angyiodyspllasia
