# Information
Encephalitis is brain inflammation, most commonly from a viral CNS infection. Viral CNS infections can also cause [[Meningitis#Aseptic Meningitis]]

The most common cause in the *Western* world is [[#HSV-1]]. Others include:
1. **Mosquito viruses**
	1. St. Louis encephalitis virus
	2. Eastern equine encephalitis
	3. West Nie virus
	4. California encephalitis virus
3. [[Rabies]]
4. [[Mumps]]
5. [[HIV]]

## HSV-1
This is the **most important etiology to identify**. Without treatment, it is *fatal*. It is often re-activation of latent HSV-1
Investigation signs include, in addition to normal signs:
1. Red cells in CSF
2. Temporal lobe edema

# History
### Symptoms

		1. If not seen and sensorium is intact, consider [[Meningitis]]
	2. Seizures
	3. Motor or sensory deficits⬆️
### Risk factors:
