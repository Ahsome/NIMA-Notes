# DDx:
- [[Seizure]]
	- Tonic-clonic activity
	- Tongue biting
	- Incontinence
	- Post-ictal state (confusion after LOC)
- Mechanical [[Falls]] +/- head trauma
- Narcolepsy 

> [!Important]
- RARE causes NOT TO MISS
	- [[Pulmonary Embolus]]
	- Subarachnoid haemorrhage
	- Shock
	- Atrial myxoma (tumour of atrium)

# Vasovagal Syncope
NEUROCARDIOGENIC - sudden increase in parasympathetic outflow, with reduced sympathetic input

### Triggers:
- Emotional stress 
- Pain
- Fear
- Heat 
- Prolonged standing
- Situational:
	- Coughing
	- Sneezing
	- Urinating
	- Defecation
	- Swallowing

### Clinical diagnosis + examination findings:
- Bradycardia
- Vasodilation
- Hypotension
- Trigger
- Prodrome - nausea, diaphoresis, pallor, feeling faint
- Rapid return to consciousness
- On awakening, patient feels tired (due to vasodilation)
- No ECG findings

### Management: 
Reassurance

---
# Orthostatic Syncope

Syncope with standing --> exaggerated fall in BP

### Risk Factors
| Hypovolaemia      | Autonomic failure | Medications   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Poor fluid intake | Diabetes          | Beta blockers |
| Diuretics         | Parkinson's (especiallly with levodopa treatment)       | alpha blockers              |

### Management:
- Improves with IV fluids

---

# Cardiogenic Syncope

- Sudden fall in cardiac output
- ==Abrupt without a prodrome ==
- Sometimes preceded by palpitations or chest pain
- Extensive cardiac history 

### Causes:
| Ischaemia | Arrhythmia  | Outflow Obstruction         |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Very rare | Bradycardia | Aortic stenosis             |
|           | SVT / VT    | Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy |
|           |             |                             |

### Investigations:
- ECG - heart block or arrhythmia
- History - CVS risk factors
- Exam - murmur
- Echocardiogram - outflow obstruction

## Subtype - Carotid Sinus Syncope:
- Carotid sinus hypersensitivty (baroreceptors)
- Patient education is required
