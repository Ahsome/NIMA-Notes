# Information
Headache is a painful sensation in any part of the head, ranging from sharp to dull, that may occur with other symptoms. These can be either primary headaches, or secondary to other sources. For secondary, it is *critical* to exclude life-threatening causes, even if unlikely. See [[#Initial management:]]

Primay causes include:
1. Tension headache
2. Migraine headache
3. Cluster headache

## Tension headache
It is the **most common** headache. No known etiology, probably multifactorial. There is a *lack* of photophobia, ponophobia, or aura. It is considered chronic when >15 days/month

## Migraine headache
Migraine pathophysiology is incopletely understood. The most likely theory is the "cortical spreading depression" theory. This involves a wave of nerve depolarisation across the cerebral cortex. This *activates* the [[Trigeminal nerve]], causing paine

Migraine headaches has episodic phases that goes through phases:
1. Prodrome (75% of patients), 1-2 days before headache. See [[#^1f7d8d|Prodrome symptoms]]
2. Aura: Slow development of non-headache symptom. See [[#^d15b83|Aura symptoms]]
3. Headache

Pregnancies *reduce* headaches. However, management and drug use change for safety reasons. See [[#Migraine Headhache management:]]

## Cluster Headache
A very rare headache disorder. It is poorly understood, seen primarily in men and smokers.

## Paroxysmal Hemicrania
A very, very rare headache. Even less understood than [[#Cluster Headache]] but with similar symptoms. See [[#^017128|Comparison between Paroxysmal Hemicrania and Cluster Headache]]

## Low Pressure Headache:
A headache due to a drop in CSF pressure. It clasically exhibits **postural headache**. It improves lying flat, and worsens sitting up
Common causes include:
- After *lumbar puncture*
- After *epidular anaesthesia*

> [!Important]
- It is important with headaches to **rule out** life-threatening causes, even when it is unlikely
- Lack of papilledema helps exclude life-threatening causes of headaches
- Primary headaches are *all diagnosed clinically*. There are no investigations, blood test or imaging ^ba1cb7
- Women with migraines *should not use estrogen-containing OCPs* due to risk of **stroke** ^be3ebf
- Triptans can cause overuse headache if repeated >10 days/month
- Triptans can cause serotonin syndrome if combined with MAOi. Use SSRI or SNRI
- _In pregnancy_: **Avoid anticonvulants, especially valproate** as they cause *neural tube defects*

# Management
## Initial management:
Initial management involves first identifying and ruling out serious but unlikely causes of headaches via history and neurological examination. These include:

| Warning symptoms                                 | Possible diagnosis                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sudden onset                                     | Subarachnoid haemorrhage, Dissection                          |
| First headache with neurological signs/confusion | Stroke, thrombosis                                            |
| Patient > 50yo                                   | Giant cell arteritis, mass leion, stroke                      |
| After head trauma                                | SUbdural/EPidural haemorrhage                                 |
| Frequency increases over weeks                   | Mass lesion, subdural haemorrhage                             |
| New onset who has HIV/Cancer/Immunosupressed     | Meningitis, abscess, metastasis                               |
| Signs of systemic illnesses                      | Systemic infection, meningitis, encephalitis, vasculitis      |
| Papillodema                                      | Mass lesion, Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, Thrombosos |
| Positional headahce and cough headache           | Space-occupyin lesion, chiari malformation                                                              |

Treatment can then be provided assuming it's a primary headache.

## Tension Headache management:
**First-line** treatment is NSAIDS. This is often combined with caffeine.
1. Aspirin, 600mg to 900mg
2. Ibuprofin, 400mg
3. Naproxen, 500mg to 750mg
4. Paracetaml, 1g

**Prophylaxis** for chronic tension can be given:

| Drug          | Amount                                             | Duration       | Extra      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Amitryptyline |10mg, increase by 10mg every 7 days to max of 75mg| OD, 8 weeks    | First line |
| Notriptyline  | ^^                                                 | ^^             | ^^         |
| Mirtazapine   | 15mg to 30mg                                       | OD, 8-12 weeks |          At night  |
| Velafaxine    | 75mg, increase to 150mg if needed                  | OD, 8-12 weeks | After food           |


## Migraine Headhache management:
Treatment involves:
1. Abortive therapy: Used in acute migraine
2. Prophylactic therapy: Prevent further migraines, such as avoiding triggers, lifestyle, and certain drugs

An important complication is that migraines and exogenous estrogen **increase the risk of stroke**. This is *especially* true with migraines and aura. As such, *women with migraines* ***should not use estrogen-containing OCPs***. They should use progesterone-containing pills

### Abortive therapy:
**Abortive therapy** include [[Triptans]], that are serotonin agonists and inhibit trigeminal nerve activity, reducing vasoactive peptide release. These include:
1. Sumatriptan
2. Zolmitriptan
3. Eletriptan
4. Rizatriptan
5. [[Lasmitidan]]: Selective serotonin 1F receptor agonist, no vasocontrictor activity

Other examples include:
1. High dose NSAIDs
2. Antiemetics: Dopamine antagonists
	1. Improve nausea and pain.
	2. Includes:
		1. Metoclopromide
		2. Ondansetron
		3. Domperidone
		4. Chlropromazine
		5. Prochlorperazine

>[!Warning]+ In Pregnancy
*In pregnancy*: Acetaminophen is safest. NSAIDs are second line, with [[Triptans]] for moderate to severe symptoms

#### Contraindications:
**Triptans:**
1. Use over 10 days per month is not recommended, as it can cause an *overuse headache*.
2. It can also lead to the [[Serotonin syndrome]] when combined with [[MAOi]]. There is less risk with SSRI or SNRI
3. Given triptans cause vasoconstriction, it is contraindicated in the following:
	1. [[Peripheral Vascular Disease]]
	2. [[Coronary Artery Disease]]
	3. [[Cerebrovascular disease]]
	4. Uncontrolled [[Hypertension]]
	5. Only exception is [[Lasmitidan]]: Selective serotonin 1F receptor agonist, no vasocontrictor activity

**Antiemetics**
1. Due to dopamine effects, it can cause dystonia

### Prevetative Therapy:
This is done for patients with >3 headaches per month. This includes:
1. Avoid known triggers for headaches
2. Healthy lifestyle, such as sleep, diet, and exercise
3. Certain drugs to reduce migraine frequency:

| Drug class      |Contraindications| Name          |Explanation|
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Anticonvulsants |Avoid in *pregnancy* <br>Can cause neural tube defects| Topiramate    |Very effective for migraine, leads to mental dulling/sensation <br> <br>Low risk of [[Kidney stones]] due to weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitor activity. <br>Patients need to hydrate|
| ^^              |^^| Valproate     |             |
| Beta-blocker    |   | Propranalol   |  |
| Antidepressants |   | Amitriptyline |             |
| ^^              |   | Venlafaxine              |             |

>[!Warning]+ In Pregnancy
*In pregnancy*: Beta-blockers are recommended for prevention

>[!Danger]+ In Pregnancy
*In pregnancy*: **Avoid anticonvulants, especially valproate** as they cause *neural tube defects*

>[!Danger]+ No estrogen-containing OCPs
>![[#^be3ebf]]

## Cluster Headache management:
Management includes:
1. First line, acute treatment
2. Bridging treatment, until-
3. Prophylaxis treatment

**First line treatment** include:
1. Oxygen: Mechanism unclear, may be due to O2-induced vasoconstiction and inhibition of neuronal activation in trigeminal nculeus
	1. 100% 15L/min for 15-20 minutes
2. Triptans:
	1. Sumatriptan
	2. Rizatriptan
	3. Zolmitriptan

**Bridging treatment** include:
1. Prednisolone, short course
2. Occipital nerve block, either methylprednisolone acetate+bupivacaine or lidocaine
3. Naratriptan

**Prophylaxis**: Verapamil, highly effective, use immediate-release rather than sustained-release

Cluster headaches do *not* respond well to NSAIDs such as indomethacin, but it *is* useful for [[#Paroxysmal Hemicrania]]

>[!Important]- NSAID ineffective
>Cluster headaches do *not* respond well to NSAIDs such as indomethacin

>[!Important]- Paroxysmal Hemicrania
>Indomethacin is usefulr for Paroxysmal Hemicrania

^6df757

## Low Pressure Headache management:
First line treatment include:
1. NSAID
2. Epidural blood patch
	1. Infusion of blood into epidural space, clots over dural CSF leaks
	2. Often provides immediate symptom relief

---

# Complications
1. **Stroke**: Women with migraines who use the OCP are at an increased risk of stroke, especially with an aura. See [[#Migraine Headhache management:]]
2. Overuse headache: Repeated use of [[Triptans]] over 10 days>month can cause a migranine
3. [[Serotonin syndrome]]: Can occur when [[Triptans]] are combined with [[MAOi]]
