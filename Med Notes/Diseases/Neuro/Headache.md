# Information
Headache is a painful sensation in any part of the head, ranging from sharp to dull, that may occur with other symptoms. These can be either primary headaches, or secondary to other sources. For secondary, it is *critical* to exclude life-threatening causes, even if unlikely. See [[#Initial management:]]

Primay causes include:
1. Tension headache
2. Migraine headache
3. Cluster headache



> [!Important]
- It is important with headaches to **rule out** life-threatening causes, even when it is unlikely
- Lack of papilledema helps exclude life-threatening causes of headaches
- Primary headaches are *all diagnosed clinically*. There are no investigations, blood test or imaging
