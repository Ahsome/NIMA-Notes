# Information
Meningitis is inflammation of the **leptomeninges**. This is the inner two meninges - arachnoid and pia mater. It does *not* include the dural mater. It also involves the CSF, which is located in the subarachnoid space
![[Pasted image 20230516003453.png]]

It usually has an **infectious** cause, whether it be viral, bacterial, fungal. This can be [[#Aseptic Meningitis|aseptic]].
It can *rarely* be due to cancer, sarcoid, or inflammatory diseases

## Aseptic Meningitis
This is a *self-limited* meningeal inflammation **without** evidence of bacterial infection. Sometimes called **viral meningitis**.
Usually due to an **enterovirus**, especially [[Coxsackievirus]].
- Mostly transmitted by fecal-oral route

This is suspected based on CSF results (See [[#Investigations]] for more detail):
1. Cell count <500microL
2. >50% lymphocytes
3. Noral glucose
4. Negative Gram stain

## Herpes Simplex Meningitis

>[!Important]

> [!Important]
- Babies cannot identify headache or photophobia, so must consider meningitis in suspected symptoms
- Most of the [[#Complications]] of [[Meningitis]] are due to **bacterial meningitis** ^etq486

# History
### Symptoms
1. Fever
2. Headache
3. Photophobia
4. Lethargy, but *intact* sensorium
	1. If the patient is confused or disoriented, consider [[Encephalitis]]
5. Nuchal rigidity: Pain when trying to move the back of neck
6. Petechial rash
	1. Only for a subset of patients, but classic finding in [[Meningococcal Meningitis]]
	2. Due to an infection by [[Neisseria Meningitidis]]
	3. Indicates meningococcemia and [[thromocytopenia]]
	4. ![[Pasted image 20230516004438.png]]

## Examination findings
| Key Findings | Result   | Explanation   |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
|Kernig sign |Painful extension of knee |When the patient has their thigh bent at the hip, with knee at 90 degrees, there is subsequent painful extension of the knee by the examiner with resistance <br>![[Pasted image 20230516003929.png\|150]]<br><br>This is a *sign* of **meningismus** |
|Brudzinski sign|Involuntary lifting of legs|When the patient is lyin flat and lifts their head off the table, there is *involuntary* lifting of the legs <br> <br>This is a *sign* of **meningismus**|

>[!Warning] Non-specific signs in infants
>Due to infants not being able to communicate, they cannot state if they have a headache or photophobia. As such, it is important to consider meningitis or [[Sepsis (and SIRS)]] when:
>- Fever
>- Lethargy
>- Poor feeding
>- Inconsolable crying

## Investigations
A **lumbar puncture** is needed for a diagnosis of [[Meningitis]], with the CSF undergoing spinal fluid testing. This checks for:
1. Cell count
2. Differential
3. Glucose
4. Protein
5. Gram Stain
6. Culture

|Key Tests   |Result |Normal  |Bacterial |Viral  |Viral TB   |
| ------------------------- | --- | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Lumbar puncture|WBC|<5|\>1000|5-500|Variable|
|^^|Differential|--|PMNs (Neutraphils)|Lymphocytes|Lymphocytes |
|^^|Glucose|50-75|⬇|Normal |⬇|
|^^|Protein|60|⬆|Normal/⬆|⬆|

| Additional Tests               |  Result   | Explanation                |
| ------------------------------ | --- | --------------------- |
|CT scan|Mass/ICP|Used to exclude mass or increased ICP, due to risk herniation. Not routinely performed, except with indications: <br>- Immunocompromised state (e.g. [[HIV]]) <br>- History of mass lesion <br>- New onset [[Seizure]] <br>- Papilledema <br>- Abnormal LOC <br>- Focal neurologic deficits|

# Management
## Treatment


## Management for Aseptic Meningitis
Aseptic meningitis management involes:
1. Antibiotics, until cultures are negative. You cannot exclude bacterial meningitis solely on investigations besides culture.
2. Supportive care, as it is often self-limited

## Drug overview

## Criteria
### Example severity/test score:
![[Asthma#^6df757]]

# Complications
1. Hydrocephalus: Due to scare tissue in the meninges, impacting CSF drainage
2. Hearing loss
3. [[Seizure]]
4. Death
