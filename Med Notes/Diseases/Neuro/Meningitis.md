# Information
Meningitis is inflammation of the **leptomeninges**. This is the inner two meninges - arachnoid and pia mater. It does *not* include the dural mater. It also involves the CSF, which is located in the subarachnoid space
![[Pasted image 20230516003453.png]]

It usually has an **infectious** cause, whether it be viral, bacterial, fungal. This can be [[#Aseptic Meningitis|aseptic]].
It can *rarely* be due to cancer, sarcoid, or inflammatory diseases

## Aseptic Meningitis
This is a *self-limited* meningeal inflammation **without** evidence of bacterial infection. Sometimes called **viral meningitis**.
Usually due to an **enterovirus**, especially [[Coxsackievirus]].
- Mostly transmitted by fecal-oral route

This is suspected based on CSF results (See [[#Investigations]] for more detail):
1. Cell count <500microL
2. >50% lymphocytes
3. Noral glucose
4. Negative Gram stain

### Herpes Simplex Meningitis
Due to a **primary** [[Sexually Transmitted Disease#Genital herpes:|HSV]] infection, which can lead to aseptic meningitis due to HSV
This is usually HSV-2, as HSV-1 often causes [[Encephalitis]]
This causes **genital lesions** on most patients:
![[Pasted image 20230516010536.png]]

## Bacterial Meningitis:
Suspected based on CSF [[#Investigations|results]].
- Cell count > 1000/microL
- >80% neutrophils (PMNs)
- ⬇ glucose, ⬆ protein
- ✅ Gram stain

Common causes include:
1. Strep pneumonia
2. Neisseria Meningitis
3. H. Influenze (Children not vaccinated)
4. MRSA
5. Listeria monocytogenes (immunocompromised, >50yo *or* neonates)

> [!Important]
- Babies cannot identify headache or photophobia, so must consider meningitis in suspected symptoms
- Most of the [[#Complications]] of [[Meningitis]] are due to **bacterial meningitis** ^etq486
- If suspected [[#Herpes Simplex Meningitis]], treat with ***Acyclovir*** ^rzqcos

# History
### Symptoms
1. Fever
2. Headache
3. Photophobia
4. Lethargy, but *intact* sensorium
	1. If the patient is confused or disoriented, consider [[Encephalitis]]
5. Nuchal rigidity: Pain when trying to move the back of neck
6. Petechial rash
	1. Only for a subset of patients, but classic finding in [[Meningococcal Meningitis]]
	2. Due to an infection by [[Neisseria Meningitidis]]
	3. Indicates meningococcemia and [[thromocytopenia]]
	4. ![[Pasted image 20230516004438.png]]

## Examination findings
| Key Findings | Result   | Explanation   |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
|Kernig sign |Painful extension of knee |When the patient has their thigh bent at the hip, with knee at 90 degrees, there is subsequent painful extension of the knee by the examiner with resistance <br>![[Pasted image 20230516003929.png\|150]]<br><br>This is a *sign* of **meningismus** |
|Brudzinski sign|Involuntary lifting of legs|When the patient is lyin flat and lifts their head off the table, there is *involuntary* lifting of the legs <br> <br>This is a *sign* of **meningismus**|

>[!Warning] Non-specific signs in infants
>Due to infants not being able to communicate, they cannot state if they have a headache or photophobia. As such, it is important to consider meningitis or [[Sepsis (and SIRS)]] when:
>- Fever
>- Lethargy
>- Poor feeding
>- Inconsolable crying


| Additional Findings | Result   | Explanation   |

## Investigations
A **lumbar puncture** is needed for a diagnosis of [[Meningitis]], with the CSF undergoing spinal fluid testing. This checks for:
1. Cell count
2. Differential
3. Glucose
4. Protein
5. Gram Stain
6. Culture

|Key Tests   |Result |Normal  |Bacterial |Viral  |Viral TB   |
| ------------------------- | --- | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Lumbar puncture|WBC|<5|\>1000|5-500|Variable|

| Additional Tests               |  Result   | Explanation                |
| ------------------------------ | --- | --------------------- |
|CT scan|Mass/ICP|Used to exclude mass or increased ICP, due to risk herniation. Not routinely performed, except with indications: <br>- Immunocompromised state (e.g. [[HIV]]) <br>- History of mass lesion <br>- New onset [[Seizure]] <br>- Papilledema <br>- Abnormal LOC <br>- Focal neurologic deficits|

# Management
## Overall management:
1. Identify whether the cause of meningitis is due to bacterial, viral, fungal/TB, or other cause via LP. See [[#Investigations]]
	1. If suspected bacterial after LP, treat with antibiotics empirically, shift after culture. Early [[Dexamethasone]] is recommended to reduce risk of mortality (Step pneumo) and hearing loss (H Influenza). See [[#Management of Bacterial Meningitis]]
	2. If suspected viral after LP, provide antibiotics until cultures are negative. Support, or acyclovir if [[Sexually Transmitted Disease#Genital herpes:|HSV]]

## Management of Bacterial Meningitis
Treatment is **antibiotics**:
- Due to culture taking days, cannot wait for culture to drive choice of drug
- Empiric antibiotics are administered
- Therapy modified based on culture result

## Management for Aseptic Meningitis
Aseptic meningitis management involes:
1. Antibiotics, until cultures are negative. You cannot exclude bacterial meningitis solely on investigations besides culture.
2. Supportive care, as it is often self-limited
3. If the patient is suspected to have [[#Herpes Simplex Meningitis]]: Treat with ***Acyclovir***

If meningococcaemia is suspected in **community** setting, use:
1. Benzylpenicillin IV, quickly
2. Ceftriaxone IV/IM, quickly
	1. Useful if penicillin allergy

If meningococcaemia is suspected in **hospital** setting, use:
1. Neonates
	1. Most likely due to *Listeria*
	2. As such, use Benzylpenicillin
2. Adults and children >2mo
	1. Ceftriaxone
	2. Cefotaxime + [[Dexamethasone]]
	3. If risk of *Listeria*, such as old patient or immunocompramised, add [[Benzylpenicillin]]
		1. If severe allergy, consider  [[Bactrim]] ([[Trimethoprim]]+[[Sulfamethaxole]] )
