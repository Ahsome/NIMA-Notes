# Information
Meningitis is inflammation of the **leptomeninges**. This is the inner two meninges - arachnoid and pia mater. It does *not* include the dural mater. It also involves the CSF, which is located in the subarachnoid space
![[Pasted image 20230516003453.png]]

It usually has an **infectious** cause, whether it be viral, bacterial, fungal. This can be [[#Aseptic Meningitis|aseptic]]. It could also be [[Encephalitis]].
It can *rarely* be due to cancer, sarcoid, or inflammatory diseases

## Aseptic Meningitis
This is a *self-limited* meningeal inflammation **without** evidence of bacterial infection. Sometimes called **viral meningitis**. Viral CNS infection can also cause [[Encephalitis]]
Usually due to an **enterovirus**, especially [[Coxsackievirus]].
- Mostly transmitted by fecal-oral route

This is suspected based on CSF results (See [[#Investigations]] for more detail):
1. Cell count <500microL
2. \>50% lymphocytes
3. Noral glucose
4. Negative Gram stain

### Herpes Simplex Meningitis
Due to a **primary** [[Sexually Transmitted Disease#Genital herpes:|HSV]] infection, which can lead to aseptic meningitis due to HSV
This is usually HSV-2, as HSV-1 often causes [[Encephalitis]]
This causes **genital lesions** on most patients:
![[Pasted image 20230516010536.png]]

## Bacterial Meningitis:
Suspected based on CSF [[#Investigations|results]].
- Cell count > 1000/microL
- >80% neutrophils (PMNs)
- ⬇ glucose, ⬆ protein
- ✅ Gram stain

Common causes include:
1. Strep pneumonia
2. Neisseria Meningitis
3. H. Influenze (Children not vaccinated)
4. Group B strep (younger than 2 months)
5. E.Coli (younger than 2 months)
6. MRSA
7. Listeria monocytogenes (**alcohol abuse**, **immunocompromised**, >**50yo** *or* **neonates**)

### Streptococcus Pneumonia
**Most common** cause of meningitis in **adults**. *Gram positive lancet-shaped cocci in pairs*
![[Pasted image 20230516015249.png]]
- Most strains susceptibile to ceftriaxone and 3rd gen cephalosporin
- Beta-lactam resistant organisms possible
	- Can add vancomycin for this
- Increased risk of **splenic dysfunction**, as spleen is important in clearing encapsulated bacteria

### Neisseria Meningitis:
*Second most common* cause of menigitis in **adults**. *Gram negative cocci in pairs (diplococci)*
![[Pasted image 20230516015635.png]]
- May cause a [[Meningitis#^4endji|petechial rash]].
- Transmitted by **respiratory droplets**
	- Hospitalised patients need **droplet precautions**, usually for 24hr after antibiotics
	- Close contacts receive prophylaxis due to possible outbreaks
	- See [[#Management of Bacterial Meningitis]]

### Haemophilus Influenzae
It is a *Gram negative, small rod*. **Present in young children**. It **used** to be the most common cause of bacterial meningitis before the vaccine
- Vaccine given infancy
	- H FLu meningitis almost always occurs in unimmunised childen

### Listeria:
It is a *Gram-positive rod*. Present in **Adults (>50)** and **Neonates**

It thrives in **poor cell-mediated immunity**:
- HIV
- Organ transplant
- Pregnancy
- Alcohol abuse

In adults, exposure often from **contaminated food**:
1. Undercooked meat, unwashed vegetables
2. Unpasturised cheese/milk
3. Can cause GI illness ([[Listeriosis]])

It may colonise the female genital tract:
1. For **nenonates**, due to transplacental or vaginal transmission

### Group B Streptococci (Strep agalactiae)
**Nenonatal Meningitis**: *Gram-positive cocci in chains*, **present in newborns**
- May colonised genital tract in womon
- *Most common* cause of meningitis in newborns
- Antibiotis during labor used for preventiation

### Escherichia Coli:
**Neonatal Meningitis**: *Motile, gram-negative rod*,  **present in newborns**
- *Second most ommon* cause of meningitis in neonates
- Acquired from birth canal at delivery

### Healthcare associated meningitis:
This is meningitis that is likely to come from a hospital care setting. This is commonly caused by:
1. Cranial trauma
2. Neurosurgery
3. Spinal surgery
4. Insertion of an intracranial device

Treatment is **ceftazidime** or **cefepime**. See [[#Management of Bacterial Meningitis]]

> [!Important]
- Babies cannot identify headache or photophobia, so must consider meningitis in suspected symptoms
- Most of the [[#Complications]] of [[Meningitis]] are due to **bacterial meningitis** ^etq486
- If suspected [[#Herpes Simplex Meningitis]], treat with ***Acyclovir*** ^rzqcos

# History
### Symptoms
1. Fever
2. Headache
3. Photophobia
4. Lethargy, but *intact* sensorium
	1. If the patient is confused or disoriented, consider [[Encephalitis]]
5. Nuchal rigidity: Pain when trying to move the back of neck
6. Petechial rash ^4endji
	1. Only for a subset of patients, but classic finding in [[Meningococcal Meningitis]]
	2. Due to an infection by [[Neisseria Meningitidis]]
	3. Indicates meningococcemia and [[thromocytopenia]]
	4. ![[Pasted image 20230516004438.png]]

## Examination findings
| Key Findings | Result   | Explanation   |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
|Kernig sign |Painful extension of knee |When the patient has their thigh bent at the hip, with knee at 90 degrees, there is subsequent painful extension of the knee by the examiner with resistance <br>![[Pasted image 20230516003929.png\|150]]<br><br>This is a *sign* of **meningismus** |
|Brudzinski sign|Involuntary lifting of legs|When the patient is lyin flat and lifts their head off the table, there is *involuntary* lifting of the legs <br> <br>This is a *sign* of **meningismus**|

>[!Warning] Non-specific signs in infants
>Due to infants not being able to communicate, they cannot state if they have a headache or photophobia. As such, it is important to consider meningitis or [[Sepsis (and SIRS)]] when:
>- Fever
>- Lethargy
>- Poor feeding
>- Inconsolable crying

## Investigations
A **lumbar puncture** is needed for a diagnosis of [[Meningitis]], with the CSF undergoing spinal fluid testing. This checks for:
1. Cell count
2. Differential
3. Glucose
4. Protein
5. Gram Stain
6. Culture

# Management
## Overall management:
1. Identify whether the cause of meningitis is due to bacterial, viral, fungal/TB, or other cause via LP. See [[#Investigations]]
	1. If suspected bacterial after LP, treat with antibiotics empirically, shift after culture. Early [[Dexamethasone]] is recommended to reduce risk of mortality (Step pneumo) and hearing loss (H Influenza) *before* antibiotics. See [[#Management of Bacterial Meningitis]]
	2. If suspected viral after LP, provide antibiotics until cultures are negative. Support, or acyclovir if [[Sexually Transmitted Disease#Genital herpes:|HSV]]

If bacteria, and culture has come:
1. If [[Neisseria Meningitidis]], **droplet precautions** for 23 hours
2. Close contacts receive prophylaxis due to possible outbreaks

## Management of Bacterial Meningitis
Treatment is **antibiotics**:
- Due to culture taking days, cannot wait for culture to drive choice of drug
- Empiric antibiotics are administered
- Therapy modified based on culture result
- Early [[Dexamethasone]] is recommended to reduce risk of mortality (Step pneumo) and hearing loss (H Influenza).
	- Damage due to bacterial cell death leading to damage and inflammation of surrounding tissue
	- Gien empirically *prior* to antibiotics
	- Adults:
		- **Continue** only if S. pneumonia is causative agent
	- Children
		- Greatest benefit with H Influenze type B (rare due to vaccination)
		- Controversial
- If [[Neisseria Meningitidis]], droplet precautions for 24 hours and prophylaxis for close contacts

If meningococcaemia is suspected in **community** setting, use:
1. Benzylpenicillin IV, quickly
2. Ceftriaxone IV/IM, quickly
	1. Useful if penicillin allergy

If meningococcaemia is suspected in **hospital** setting, use:
1. Neonates <1month
	1. Most likely due to *Listeria*
		1. As such, use Benzylpenicillin
	2. Also have E. Coli and GBS
		1. Cefotaxime
2. Children 1-2 months
	1. Cefotaxime or...
	2. Ceftriaxone + Amoxicillin or...
	3. Ampicillin
3. Adults and children >2mo
	1. Ceftriaxone
	2. Cefotaxime + [[Dexamethasone]]
	3. If risk of *Listeria*, such as **old patient** or **immunocompramised** or ==**alcohol overuse**==, add [[Benzylpenicillin]]
		1. If severe allergy, consider  [[Bactrim]] ([[Trimethoprim]]+[[Sulfamethaxole]] )
	4. Add vancomycin if gram-positive diplococci seen, or pneumococcal antigen in CSF is positive
4. Suspected cranial trauma, neurosurgery, spinal surgery, or insertion of an intracranial device
	1. Could have gained meningitis from a **hospital setting**
	2. Ceftazidime or...
	3. Cefepime

## Management for Aseptic Meningitis
Aseptic meningitis management involes:
1. Antibiotics, until cultures are negative. You cannot exclude bacterial meningitis solely on investigations besides culture.
2. Supportive care, as it is often self-limited
3. If the patient is suspected to have [[#Herpes Simplex Meningitis]]: Treat with ***Acyclovir***
