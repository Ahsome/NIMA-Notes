# Information
Seizures is a sudden alteration in behaviour due to transient CNS electrical acitivity in the cerebral cortex.

Epilepsy - multiple unprovoked seizures

> [!Important]
- Important point

--- 
# History
### Symptoms
- Abnormal motor activity
- Abnormal sensation
- LOC
- Tongue biting
- Incontinence
- Peioral cyanosis (children)
- Aura
	- Simple, partial seizures 
	- Occipital lobe: flashing lights
	- Motor cortex: muscle jerking
- Post-ictal state: confusion, lack of alertness
	- Focal neurological deficits may be present
	- ==Key distinction from syncope==
- Most seizures are self-limited ~2mins

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tonic                    | sustained muscle tone                                       |
| Clonic                   | myoclonic muscle jerks                                      |
| Atonic                   | loss of muslce tone                                         |
| Simple                   | no alteration of consciousness                              |
| Complex                  | alteration of consciousness                                 |
| Partial                  | involves a discrete area of the brain - specific features   |
| Generalised              | entire brain affected (may begin as a partial seizure)      |
| Tonic-clonic (Grand mal) | unconsciousness, convulsions, muscle rigidity               |
| Absence (Petite mal)     | brief LOC                                                   |
| Post-ictal state         | Key distinction from syncope - confusion, lack of alertness |
|                          |                                                             |


### Risk factors:
- Fever (children)
- Lack of sleep
- Drugs, alcohol
- Hypoglycaemia
- Tumours
- Strokes
- Withdrawal - alcohol, benzos, barbituates, anticonvulsant drugs
- Infection e.g. [[Encephalitis]] or [[Meningitis]]
