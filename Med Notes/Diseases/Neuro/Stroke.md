# Information
Stroke is a "brain attack" where the patient appears struck down or has a sudden loss of neurological function.

TYPES AND MECHANISMS
 1. Ischaemic (~80%) - due to thrombus or embolism, hypoperfusion
 2. Haemorrhagic (~20%) - sudden onset with gradual increase of symptoms over minutes - hours

Major causes of ischaemic stroke
-   20% - embolus from the heart (AF)
-   20% - large artery disease (cerebral circulation or carotid)
-   25% - lacunar
-   30% - cryptogenic
-   5% - vasculitis, genetic thrombophilia, venous sinus thrombosis

Stroke syndromes ACA stroke (2%)
-   Dysarthria and dysphasia
-   Unilateral contralateral limb motor weakness – lower limb especially and some shoulder involvement too
-   Minimal sensory changes
-   Urinary incontinence


MCA stroke (most common)
-   Contralateral hemiparesis – facial, upper limb and of lower limb (often)
	- Leg weakness can cause ‘ataxia’
-   Contralateral hemisensory loss – of the same regions. Often ‘pins and needles’
-   Homonymous hemianopia – complete loss of one half of the visual field. This can happen due to infarction of some of the optic tracts
-   Aphasia – expressive and/or receptive aphasias. This will occur if the left MCA is infarcted, since language is left dominant.
-   Neglect – if RHS or non-dominant hemisphere is affected.


PCA stroke – homonymous hemianopia, contralateral to the affected side.

Vertebrobasilar insufficiency/basilar stroke (20% of all strokes)
- These strokes are absolute emergencies, as it blows off the entire posterior circulation, which will impact the thalamus, cerebellum, occipital lobe and most importantly the brain stem.
-   Sudden loss of consciousness and death – pontine and brainstem infarction.
-   Rostral basilar occlusion – especially affects the thalamus, due to its supply of the thalamus being disrupted.
	- Visual and oculomotor disturbances
	- Behavioural abnormalities  
	- Hallucinations  
	- Motor function is often intact
-   Proximal basilar occlusion – can often lead straight to loss of consciousness and death due to the impact on the pons.
	- Complete loss of movement.


Cerebellar infarct (mainly non-specific symptoms)
-   Ataxia
-   Nausea and vomiting
-   Dizziness
-   Vertigo


Clues it might be a larger vessel:
-   Hemiplegia/hemiparesis
-   Speech impediment
-   Facial droop
-   Homonomous hemianopia


Left dominant vs right non-dominant stroke (cortical only)

If you’re suspecting a cortical stroke > LACS then must test aphasia (LHS) and neglect (RHS)

| Left dominant                                                         | Right non-dominant                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Speech – expressive vs receptive aphasia                              | Spatial neglect                                    |
| Constructional apraxia – inability to build, assemble or draw objects | Anosognosia – unaware something is wrong with them |
| A – acalculia (unable to calculate)                                   | Dressing apraxia – can’t dress independantly       | 
| A – alexia (word blindness)                                           |                                                    |
| A – astereognosis (unable to use touch alone to identify item)        |                                                    |
| L – LHS/RHS disorientation                                            |                                                    |
| F – finger agnosia                                                    |                                                    |
   





Lacunar strokes – SUBCORTICAL STROKES. Pontine strokes can also have the same clinical pictures too.
-   Pure motor (50% cases) – complete hemiparesis (face, UL, LL) contralateral to stroke o Basal ganglia or motor fibres in internal capsule (posterior limb)
-   Pure sensory – complete hemi-sensory abnormalities (face, UL, LL) contralateral to stroke site.
	- VPL nucleus of thalamus
-   Ataxic hemiparesis – IPSILATERAL hemiparesis with ataxia of the same side. Can happen in pontine strokes and internal capsule (posterior limb) strokes. Shows cerebellar signs as well as weakness.
-   Sensorimotor stroke – complete contralateral hemiparesis and hemi sensory loss due to infarction of the thalamus and adjacent posterior limb of internal capsule.


> [!Important]
- TIA - symptoms resolve < 24 hrs (transient ischaemic attack)

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF STROKE

30% of patients with suspected stroke have a ‘stroke mimic’:
-   Tumour
-   Subdural haematoma
-   Subarachnoid haemorrhage
-   Migraine
-   Hypoglycaemia
-   Post ictal paralysis (Todd’s paresis)
-   Cerebral abscess

3.  RISK FACTORS FOR STROKES
    
    -   Smoking
        
    -   Diabetes
        
    -   Metabolic disease – dyslipidaemia especially
        
    -   HTN
        
    -   Obesity
        
    -   Lack of exercise
        
4.  ACUTE STROKE MANAGEMENT (ISCHAEMIC)
    

Immediate investigations:  
• CT head (non-contrast) – MAINSTAY. Especially handy to see if it is an ischaemic or

haemorrhagic stroke. Haemorrhagic stroke needs immediate surgery, but ischaemic strokes can be managed with lysis or clot retrieval. You can’t lyse haemorrhagic stroke, you will make things worse.

o Early on, you won’t see any changes on the CT, but you need to rule out haemorrhagic stroke

o Loss of grey/white differentiation o Dense MCA sign and insular ribbon

-   Cerebral perfusion scan – can determine the infarcted region and associated penumbra. If the infarcted region is small and the penumbra is large, this patient will benefit HEAPS from reperfusion strategies. ONLY IF t>6hr
    
-   ECG – look for AFIB, it can be a potential aetiology of an ischaemic stroke. o TTE or TOE – can exclude thrombus in LAA.
    
-   Carotid ultrasound – massive anterior circulation strokes may involve the carotid arteries.
    
-   MRI – a little later on, when the acute management has been completed, an MRI will tell you the extent of ischaemic damage that has occurred.
    
-   Full blood count – if patient is thrombocytopaenic, think again before anticoagulating, because you may cause a haemorrhage even if there isn’t one already.
    
    o Cholesterol – risk stratification
    
    o BG and HbA1c – diabetic control for risk stratification (long term)
    
-   Coagulation study – for the same reason, assess coagulation status, because if
    
    severely deficient in factors, anticoagulation may be detrimental.
    
    NIHSS stroke severity score –
    
    used to assess neurological and functional impairment secondary to a stroke. It is also good for a long-term predictor of outcome after an acute stroke.
    

Study showed that at 3 months:

NIHSS 0-3 – 95% good outcome NIHSS 4-6 – 87% good outcome NIHSS 7-10 – 78% good outcome NIHSS 11-15 – 56% good outcome NIHSS 16-22 – 42% good outcome NIHSS 3 23 – 18% good outcome

Treatment – the aim is to re-perfuse EARLY. The earlier you treat, the higher chance you will be able to save the penumbra and revive as much of brain as possible. This will reduce long term disability and mortality.

Lysis (clot busting) – medical treatment WITHIN 4.5HR of symptoms • Alteplase – tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)

o Also used for MI  
o BUSTS the embolus – will return blood flow to ischaemic area

Hx of intracranial haemorrhage NIHSS < 4 (but use clinical judgement) Severe head trauma/stroke in 3/12 Recent GIT haemorrhage  
Current anticoagulation

-   Antihypertensives – to reduce the BP down below 185/110. Lysis shouldn’t be started until after this target is reached, because of potential HTN related haemorrhages. CUSHING’S reflexes!!!
    
-   Aspirin + clopidogrel – only to be used once haemorrhagic stroke has been excluded. Should be started within 48hours of stroke presentation for beneficial effects.
    
    o Dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 3 months has been shown to prevent recurrent strokes.
    
    Clot retrieval – interventional treatment WITHIN 6HR of symptoms
    

• Evidence now shows that it is still beneficial within 24 hr  
o Patients who are candidates for clot retrieval are actually a subset of patients

who are also eligible for lysis. Both treatments can be given to the same

patient.  
o START alteplase even if clot retrieval is considered  
o Patients with infective endocarditic septic emboli won’t undergo lysis but

most likely clot retrieval

• Patient selection:  
o Proximal occlusion of large artery in ANTERIOR CIRCULATION. Posterior

circulation is HARD

§ If in vertebral or basilar artery, it is shown to have better outcomes in posterior circulation patients... but not much evidence or expertise

o Small infarcted core, big penumbra

o In t > 6HR, the CT perfusion scan becomes essential in determining Tx • <6hr

o NIHSS>6  
o No intracranial haemorrhage o M1/M2, A1/A2

• 6-24hr  
o NIHSS>10

o Failed or contraindicated lysis with alteplase

Absolute contraindications Relative contraindications

Acute intracranial haemorrhage

Advanced age >75YO

Severe HTN > 185/110mmHg

Recent major surgery

Thrombocytopaenia/coagulopathy

a. ACUTE STROKE MANAGEMENT (HAEMORRHAGIC) – 17% OF STROKES

Many of these patients have long standing hypertension which will often lead to the bursting of small perforating parenchyma arteries. These include the lenticulostriate arteries. They will often also be on anticoagulation for various reasons.

AIM – stop bleeding, maintenance of haematoma size.

Reverse anticoagulation

-   IV vitamin K – reversal of warfarin with vitamin K and clotting factor infusion
    
    o NOACs are more difficult to reverse
    
-   Fresh frozen plasma – contains clotting factors
    
-   Prothrombin complex concentrate – promotes clotting
    
    Reduction of blood pressure
    

-   These patients generally present very hypertensive, up to the 200s in SBP
    
-   Use antihypertensives to reduce down to about 140mmHg SBP
    
    Surgical evacuation – is often considered but is extremely dangerous. Supratentorial haematomas is extremely dangerous to operate on. Subtentorial/cerebellar haemorrhages can be beneficial to evacuate.
    

b. TIA GRADING OF SEVERITY

ABCD2 scoring system – risk of stroke post TIA

A score of 3 or more requires an admission.

5. MOTOR AND SENSORY DYSPHASIA  
6. STROKE PREVENTION – LONG TERM MANAGEMENT

-   Aspirin or clopidogrel – antiplatelet therapy is effective in reducing risk.  
    o Aspirin monotherapy – standard long-term Tx  
    o Clopidogrel monotherapy – shown to be better than aspirin in reducing
    
    mortality and incidence of stroke. DAPT in first 3 months
    
-   Warfarin or NOACs – if patient has AFIB, which is the cause of stroke.
    
-   Carotid artery stenosis – endarterectomy vs stenting.
    
-   Statins – all patients will receive high dose statins going home.
    
-   Management of diabetes
    
-   Blood pressure control
    
-   Smoking cessation
    

Remember hypercoagulable conditions:

-   Antiphospholipid syndrome
    
-   Polycythaemia vera
    
-   Protein C and S deficiency
    
-   Antithrombin deficiency
    
-   Factor V leiden

# History
### Symptoms
The history taking should try and discern whether the patient’s symptoms is in fact from a stroke and not a stroke mimic and try and localise the stroke from the symptoms.
-   Motor changes – any clumsiness? Any weakness in the limbs? Which limbs? Which side?
-   Sensory changes – any tingling or changes in sensations in the limbs?
-   Facial droop – present? Frontalis sparing?
-   Visual changes – any loss of vision? Homonymous hemianopia?
-   Language deficits – any expressive or receptive aphasias? This helps localise.
-   Are the symptoms still here? TIAs generally last for up to an hour. Strokes much longer.
-   Headache – not usually associated with a stroke
-   Neck pain – not usually associated with stroke
-   Vomiting – not usually associated with stroke
