## Treatment
1. Alcohol withdrawal = benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam - long-lasting) 
2. Wernicke's encephalopathy - give thiamine
	1. "Banana bag" - thiamine + glucose bc if you give only glucose, you could result in worsened Wernicke's
3. Support gorups (AA)
4. Disulfiram (antabuse) - inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase 
5. Naltrexone - opioid antagonist (less of a high when drinking)
6. Acamprosate
