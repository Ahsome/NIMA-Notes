# Information
Sleep Apnea is cessation of breathing during sleep, usually > 10 seconds
Two main types:
1. Central sleep apne:; No effort to breath
2. Obstructive sleep apnea: Decreased air flow despite effort to breath
	1. ***Much more common*

### Central sleep apnea:
1. Patients with marginal ventilation when awake
	1. Hypoventilate when awake, ceases when sleep
	2. Causes:
		1. CNS disease (encephalitis)
		2. Neuromuscular disease (polio, ALS)
		3. Severe kyphoscoliosis
		4. Narcotics
2. Cheyne-Stoes breathing
	1. Common in [[Heart Failure]] and [[Stroke]]
	2. Due to delayed detecting/responce to changes in PaCO2
	3. ![[Pasted image 20230514001916.png|600]]

### Obstructive sleep apnea:
1. Recurrent soft tissue collapse in the pharynx
2. Strongest risk factor is obesity

# History
### Symptoms
1. Unrestful sleep
2. Daytime somnolence
	1. Key symptoms, if overweight and daytime somnolence think of [[Sleep Apnea]]
3. Loud snoring

### Risk factors:
**Obstructive**:
1. Obesity, strongest risk factor
