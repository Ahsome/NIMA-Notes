# Information
Sleep Apnea is cessation of breathing during sleep, usually > 10 seconds
Two main types:
1. Central sleep apne:; No effort to breath
2. Obstructive sleep apnea: Decreased air flow despite effort to breath
	1. ***Much more common*

### Central sleep apnea:
1. Patients with marginal ventilation when awake
	1. Hypoventilate when awake, ceases when sleep
	2. Causes:
		1. CNS disease (encephalitis)
		2. Neuromuscular disease (polio, ALS)
		3. Severe kyphoscoliosis
		4. Narcotics
2. Cheyne-Stoes breathing
	1. Common in [[Heart Failure]] and [[Stroke]]
	2. Due to delayed detecting/responce to changes in PaCO2
	3. ![[Pasted image 20230514001916.png|600]]

### Obstructive sleep apnea:
1. Recurrent soft tissue collapse in the pharynx
2. Strongest risk factor is obesity

# History
### Symptoms
1. Unrestful sleep
2. Daytime somnolence
	1. Key symptoms, if overweight and daytime somnolence think of [[Sleep Apnea]]
3. Loud snoring

### Risk factors:
**Obstructive**:
1. Obesity, strongest risk factor

| --------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
|Polysomnography<br>"Sleep study"|Number of apnea episodes|Monitors patient sleep:<br>- EEG <br>- Eye movements <br>- O2 level <br>- HR <br>- RR|

| ------------------------------ | --- | --------------------- |
|FBC|Increased hematocrit|Due to [[Erythropoiesis]] from chronic hypoxia|

# Management
## Treatment
Overall treatment involves:
1. Weight loss: Takes time, not best for exhausted patients
2. CPAP: First line for symptomatic patients
	1. Alternative: Oral appliances are devices that are worn in the mouth during sleep to reposition the jaw and tongue to keep the airway open
3. Upper airway surgery: Severe disease
4. Regularly monitoring for changes in symptoms and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.

# Complications
1. Low levels of oxygen at night, causes cardiac issues:
	1. [[Hypertension]]
	2. [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
	3. [[Arrhythmias]]
	4. [[Erythropoiesis]]
		1. Due to chronic hypoxia
		2. Causes EPO release
2. Sudden Death
