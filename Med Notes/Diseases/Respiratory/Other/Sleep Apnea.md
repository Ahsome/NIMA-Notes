# Information
Sleep Apnea is cessation of breathing during sleep, usually > 10 seconds
Two main types:
1. Central sleep apne:; No effort to breath
2. Obstructive sleep apnea: Decreased air flow despite effort to breath
	1. ***Much more common*

### Central sleep apnea:
1. Patients with marginal ventilation when awake
	1. Hypoventilate when awake, ceases when sleep
	2. Causes:
		1. CNS disease (encephalitis)
		2. Neuromuscular disease (polio, ALS)
		3. Severe kyphoscoliosis
		4. Narcotics
2. Cheyne-Stoes breathing
	1. Common in [[Heart Failure]] and [[Stroke]]
	2. Due to delayed detecting/responce to changes in PaCO2
	3. ![[Pasted image 20230514001916.png|600]]

### Obstructive sleep apnea:
1. Recurrent soft tissue collapse in the pharynx
2. Strongest risk factor is obesity

> [!Important]
1. Sleep apnea is a condition where breathing stops during sleep for more than 10 seconds.
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea, which involves decreased airflow despite effort to breathe, is much more common than central sleep apnea.
3.  Central sleep apnea is often caused by CNS disease, neuromuscular disease, severe kyphoscoliosis, or narcotics, while obesity is the strongest risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea.
4.  Symptoms of sleep apnea include unrestful sleep, daytime somnolence, and loud snoring.
5.  Risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea include obesity, while central sleep apnea is often related to marginal ventilation when awake.
6.  Polysomnography (sleep study) is a key examination to identify the number of apnea episodes.
7.  Management of sleep apnea involves weight loss, CPAP, upper airway surgery, and regularly monitoring for changes in symptoms and comorbidities.
8.  Low oxygen levels during sleep can cause complications such as hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, and erythropoiesis due to chronic hypoxia and EPO release.
9.  Oral appliances are an alternative to CPAP for symptomatic patients.
10.  Regularly monitoring for changes in symptoms and comorbidities is crucial for the management of sleep apnea.

# History
### Symptoms
1. Unrestful sleep
2. Daytime somnolence
	1. Key symptoms, if overweight and daytime somnolence think of [[Sleep Apnea]]
3. Loud snoring

### Risk factors:
**Obstructive**:
1. Obesity, strongest risk factor

# Management
## Treatment
Overall treatment involves:
1. Weight loss: Takes time, not best for exhausted patients
2. CPAP: First line for symptomatic patients
	1. Alternative: Oral appliances are devices that are worn in the mouth during sleep to reposition the jaw and tongue to keep the airway open
3. Upper airway surgery: Severe disease
4. Regularly monitoring for changes in symptoms and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.

# Complications
1. Low levels of oxygen at night, causes cardiac issues:
	1. [[Hypertension]]
	2. [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
	3. [[Arrhythmias]]
	4. [[Erythropoiesis]]
		1. Due to chronic hypoxia
		2. Causes EPO release
2. Sudden Death
