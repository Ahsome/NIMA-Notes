# Information
 
*Chronic Pulmonary Disease* is an obstructive conditions where emphysema and chronic bronchitis (productive cough for more than 3 months for 2 consecutive years) are the most common conditions.

**Chronic Bronchitis – Blue Bloater**
- Cyanosis/hypoxemia from shunting (blue)
- Hypoxemia → pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Edema from right heart failure 

**Emphysema – Pink Puffer**
- Loss of alveoli 
- Loss of surface area for O2 absorption (dead space) 
- Hyperventilation to compensate (puffer) 
- Initially this maintains O2 level (pink)


## Pathophysiology
>[!Important]
>![[Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD)#^f2cca6]]

Infectious exacerbations of COPD – constitute about 70% of all exacerbations.
- Most commonly, a LRTI is the aetiology of the precipitation. This is commonly bacterial causes of [[pneumonia]]
	- Strep. pneumoniae  
	- Haemophilus influenzae 
	- Moraxela catarrhalis
	- Staph aureus  
	- Pseudamonas aeruginosa
- Pollution, PE, SMOKING continuation, constitute the other 30% of all exacerbations.


> [!Important]
- Acute respiratory failure (type 2) with acidosis, hypercapnia and hypoxaemia can be a worst case scenario presentation. ^f2cca6
- COPD is defined by FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 ^fc0233
- Oxygen dependence, administration of CPAP/BiPAP, cachexia, functional decompensation, comorbidities (esp [[Heart Failure]]) and respiratory failure (type 2) are all indicators for poor prognosis in COPD.

# History
## Signs
- Dyspnoea – exertional dyspnoea is very likely. It is important to ascertain their exercise tolerance, how long they can walk before feeling SOB. o SOBOE
	- Can be differentiated from CCF, since no orthopnoea or PND.  
	- Tripod posture, accessory respiratory muscle usage, cyanosis can all be physical signs of dyspnoea.
-   Sputum production
- Recurrent URTI
-   Wheeze – polyphonic wheeze on auscultation. Sounds like wind.

## Risk factors 
- a1-antitrypsin deficiency – an important aetiology of COPD.
- Extensive smoking history 

## Examination findings

## Investigations
-   CXR – [[pneumonia]]? Pneumothorax? Pleural effusion? Pulmonary oedema?
	- Hyperinflation – flattened diaphragms, blunting of costophrenic angles, more than 6 anterior/10 posterior ribs, black lung fields.
- ECG - cor pulmonale (right axis deviation)
- Spirometry – the obstructive pattern.
	- Reduction in FEV1/FVC ratio < 70%
	- Irreversibility of FEV1/FVC reduction. Bronchodilator reversibility < 12%
- FBC – check especially for inflammatory markers like neutrophils, WBC, CRP and ESR to provide evidence for infection.  
	- eLFT to manage electrolytes and glucose, esp in the context of comorbidities
	- Hb values will also tell you about polycythaemia, a long-term complication of COPD’s chronic hypoxaemia.
- Sputum sample for MCS – not always useful, especially in COPD exacerbations. Treat empirically with Abs, which is usually a better option.
- ABG – assess for evidence of respiratory failure, respiratory acidosis etc.
	- Decreased pO2 with or without hypercapnia
- D dimer and CTPA – if there is reasonable suspicion of a DVT and PE.
- BNP, TTE etc – if there is reasonable suspicion that [[Heart Failure]] is the cause of worsening dyspnoea

# Management
## Treatments
### *Acute treatment*
Acute management of acute decompensated COPD
- b2 agonists – salbutamol  
	- Anti-muscarinic puffer – ipratropium. Often used in conjunct
-   Oral corticosteroids – IV hydrocortisone 200mg and oral prednisolone 30mg OD for 5-7/7
	- A short course of about 5 days is adequate and has been shown to reduce the duration of hospital stay and hasten return to baseline lung function  
	- MUST BE CAREFUL with duration as we want to ideally reduce the risks of osteoporosis and Cushing’s as a result of corticosteroid use.  
- Oxygen therapy – if the patient is hypoxaemic, oxygen should be administered.
	- Aim for SpO2–88 to 92%  
	- Aim for PaO2 – 60 to 70mmHg  
	- This goal SpO2 is lower simply because these patients have a hypoxic drive for respiration, which has been set because of their chronically hypoxaemic state. ***If you aim for 100%, then you’ll risk proper hypercapnic respiratory failure, type 2.***
- Antibiotics – used empirically to treat the infection. Hastens recovery but doesn’t necessarily ELIMINATE all the bacteria residing.
	- Amoxicillin 500mg 8hrly for 5 days or doxycycline 100mg PO for 5 days first line  
	- Roxithromycin and ceftriaxone can also be trialled if these aren’t working.

### *Long term*
#### Non-pharmacological:
- Smoking cessation. **CONSIDER USE OF NICOTINE REPLACEMENT**
- Incentive spirometry
- Pulmonary rehabilitation – improves QoL
- Exercise
- Avoidance of inhaled particulates
- Vaccination against respiratory infections (influenza, pneumococcus)

#### Pharmacological treatment:
![[Pasted image 20230507161541.png]]
- Short acting bronchodilators (SABA and SAMA) – important for symptomatic relief and improving function and QOL. They are used as rescue medications. Salbutamol and ipratropium have similar efficacy. If neither have sufficient effect on the patient, then a combination of salbutamol and ipratropium can be used.
	- Salbutamol (SABA) 
	- Terbutaline (SABA) 
	- Ipratropium (SAMA)
- Long acting bronchodilators (LABA and LAMA) – again provide symptom relief of breathlessness, improve exercise tolerance and QoL. They are shown to reduce the frequency of exacerbations. These are indicated in patients who:
	- Moderate to severe COPD  
	- It’s good practice to start with either a LAMA or LABA monotherapy. If exacerbations happen, try and step it up to a duo-therapy o Have frequent episodes of SOB despite SABA/SAMA
		- LAMA – tiotropium, glycopyrronium
		- LABA – salmeterol, eformoterol, indacaterol 
	- LAMA + LABA combination puffers are available too.
- Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) – indicated because it reduces the number of exacerbations and as a result improves prognosis and QoL. It’s important to know that these shouldn’t be very first line. If a LAMA/LABA duotherapy doesn’t work.
	- Budesonide
	- Fluticasone
	- ICS + LABA combinations are also available  
	- Advise patients to rinse mouth to prevent oral candidiasis 
	- **Symbicort – budesonide and eformoterol.* - LABA and ICS
- ICS + LABA + LAMA fixed dose inhaler OD - Trelegy Elipta 
	- fluticasone furoate + umeclidinium + vilanterol
- Home oxygen (PaO2<55%) – contraindicated in those who still smoke and non-compliant patients.
	- Symptomatic relief – especially in lung cancer patients o Improves mortality – only if used for >18 hours a day
	- Prevention of cor pulmonale and polycythaemia
