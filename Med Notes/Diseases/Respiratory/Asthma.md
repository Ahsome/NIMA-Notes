# Information
*Asthma* is obstructive lung disease characterised by ***episodic*** **reversible broncoconstriction**, usually triggered by a **Type I allergic stimulus**. This differentiaties it from [[Chronic Pulmonary Disease]], which symptoms are normally not reversible. It is most common in **children**, and is associated with other **atopic** conditions (e.g. *Rhinitis*, *Eczema*)


> [!Important]
- Key diagnosis is usually clinically, with symptoms and FEV1 improvment of 12-15% **after albuterol** ^89389e

## Pathophysiology

--- 
# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Acute asthma attack:
1. Have ***episodic*** symptoms
2. Dysnea
3. ***Wheezing***
4. Cough
5. Chest tightness
6. Decrease in peak flow from baseline

### *Risk factors*
1. Young age: It is possible with adults, but common in young age
2. Allergens - A Type I hypersensitivity reaction
3. Stress
4. Exercise
5. Aspirin
6. Family history of allergic reactions

### *Questions to ask*
>*"Do you notice any shortness of breath?"*
>*"Do you notice any wheezing? Any cough?"*
>*"Any history of allergies? Family history of allergies?"*

## Examination findings
| Key Findings         | Result    | Explanation |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Expiratory phase | Increased | Due to broncho-constriction of vessels <br>Also called decreased I/E ratio<br>Inspiration time less than expiration            |

| Additional Findings         | Result    | Explanation |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Pulsus paradoxes | Fall >= 10mmHg with inspiration | Most non-cardiac cause of pulsus paradoxus |

## Investigations

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Peak flow meter           | Reduced peak flow                                                                                   |
| Spirometry                | Reduced FEV1<br>Reduced FEV1/FVC ratio<br>FEV1 improvmeent 12% after [[Albuterol]] |
| [[Methacoline challenge]] | Causes bronchoconstriction<br><=20mcg dose needed for FEV1 reduction by 20%<br>People without asthma can handle high methacoline levels, asthma patients cannot                                      |

| Additional Tests | Result                |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| FBC              | Increased eosinophils |
| IgE levels       | Increased                      |
