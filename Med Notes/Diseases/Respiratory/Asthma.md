# Information
*Asthma* is obstructive lung disease characterised by ***episodic*** **reversible broncoconstriction**, usually triggered by a **Type I allergic stimulus**. This differentiaties it from [[Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD)]], which symptoms are normally not reversible. It is most common in **children**, and is associated with other **atopic** conditions (e.g. *Rhinitis*, *Eczema*) ^439327


> [!Important]
- Key diagnosis is usually clinically, with symptoms and FEV1 improvment of 12-15% **after albuterol** ^89389e
- If not-reversible, then unlikely [[Asthma]], more likely [[Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD)]]
- Try to do a CXR to rule out if pneumonia/infection
- If PaCO2 is increased during acute asthma attack, patient is having a respiratory attack
- Empiric antibiotics are **not recommended** during an acute attack. Unlike [[Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD)]], where you always give empiric antibiotics, regardless of CXR ^b567d6
- Corticosteroids will cause increased immature WBC (left-shift) for acute exacerbation, *do not assume* increased WBC means infection ^78a83e
- For patients with Aspirin-sensitive asthma, treatment is Leukotriene receptor antagonist such as [[Montelukast]], see [[Asthma#^39e8fe]] ^0b1e3f

## Pathophysiology
### *Aspirin-sensitive asthma*:
Can trigger [[Asthma]] in patients with [[Aspirin Exarcerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD)]]. They have symptoms of asthma and rhinosinusitis. It comes from a dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism, leading to overproduction of leukotrienes.

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Acute asthma attack:
1. Have ***episodic*** symptoms
2. Dysnea
3. ***High-pitched wheezing***
4. Cough
5. Chest tightness
6. Decrease in peak flow from baseline

### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors depends on whether its allergic asthma or non-allergic asthma:
| Allergic asthma | Non-allergic asthma |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| - **Allergy**<br>- Environmental allergens, such as pollen/domestic animals<br>- Allergy due to workplace (e.g. flour dust) <br>- Family history of allergens               |     - Viral causes<br>- Physical exertion<br>- Aspirin, See [[Asthma#*Aspirin-sensitive asthma*:]] <br>- [[GORD]], often concurrent with asthma               |

### *Questions to ask*
>*"Do you notice any shortness of breath?"*
>*"Do you notice any wheezing? Any cough?"*
>*"Any history of allergies? Family history of allergies?"*
>*"Is this consistent, or does it come in attacks/episodes?"*
>*"Does it come when you're stressed, such as exercise?"*
>*"Do you take aspirin?"*  - See [[Asthma#*Aspirin-sensitive asthma*:]]

## Examination findings
| Key Findings         | Result    | Explanation |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |

| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| FBC              | Increased eosinophils |
| IgE levels       | Increased                      |

# Management
## Treatments
### *Possible drugs:*
1. [[Beta-antagonist]]
	1. Short-acting [[Beta-antagonist]] (SABA): [[Albuterol]]
	2. Long-acting [[Beta-antagonist]] (LABA): [[Salmeterol]], [[Formoterol]]
		1. Used with inhaler over long period of time for daily use
	3. Rarely have side effects, can cause tremor and palpitations
2. [[Corticosteroids]]
	1. Can be given inhaled, oral, or IV
	2. Often cause thrush, which can be prevented by rinsing and spaces (less likely to get to mucosoul membrane)
3. Eicosanoids
	1. [[Montelukast]]: Blocks leukotrienes effect. Useful in aspirin-sensitive asthma ^39e8fe
	2. [[Zileuton]]: Blocks lipoxygenase from converting arachidonic acid to leukotrienes
4. [[Omalizumab]]: 
	1. IgG monoclonal antibody that inhibits IgE binding to IgE receptor on mast cells and basophills, prevents degranulation
	2. Given by subcutaneous injection
6. [[Cromolyn]]:
	1. Inhibits mast cell degranulation, blocks release of histamine and leukotrienes
7. [[Theyophylline]]:
	1. *Rarely* used for asthma, more commonly used for [[Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD)]]
	2. Acts as a bronchodilator

### *Acute Asthma*
#### *Management*:
1. Provide patient with **oxygen**
2. Provided nebulazied [[Albuterol]]
3. [[Corticosteroids]] needed for period of time:
	1. [[Prednisone]] 60mg daily
	2. [[Methylprednisone]] 80mg IV q8hrs
4. Rarely can be used:
	1. [[Ipratropium]]: Acts as muscurinic antagonist, more commonly used in [[Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD)]]
	2. IV [[Magnesium sulfate]]
5. ABG for normal or increased PaCO2. If so, intubate
	1. PaCO2 should be low in asthma patients since hyperventilation. If increased, onto respiratory muscle weakness. Very abnomal
