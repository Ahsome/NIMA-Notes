## Pathophysiology

# History
## Signs
### *Symptoms*
Symptoms include:
- Dyspnoea at rest/exertion - SOBAR
- Pleuritic chest pain – does it hurt more on inspiration?
	- Common in smaller lung infarcts in the more peripheral parts, resulting in inflammation of the pleura and hence pleuritic chest pain.
-   Tachypnoea 
-   Calf or thigh swelling and pain + erythema
-   Cough - are you coughing up any blood?
-   Orthopnoea 
-   Haemoptysis 
-   Haemodynamic collapse, presyncope and syncope


### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:

| Acquired risk                                    | Inherited risk            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Recent surgery                                   | Factor V Leiden           |
| Pregnancy/Birth                                  | Protein C/S deficiency    |
| Immobalisation (recent plane travel)             | Antiphospholid syndrome   |
| Recent initiation of hormone replacement therapy | Prothrombin gene mutation |
| Smoking                                          |                           |
| Active cancer                                    |                           |
| Obseity                                                 |                           |

## Examination findings
-   Tachypnoea
-   Tachycardia
-   Lower limb swelling, erythema and pain. 
-   Accentuated P2 and hence loud S2 – sign of pulmonary hypertension
	- Palpable thrill over pulmonary area
	- Tricuspid regurgitation might be present
-   Elevated JVP
	- Acute right heart failure
-   Systemic hypotension – obstructive shock (with the addition of tachycardia)


## Investigations
- Lower limb USS for DVT
- D-dimer – a rule out test. If this is negative, you can rule out DVT/PE. If it is possible, do a CTPA. D-dimer is the breakdown product of clot.
-   CTPA – pulmonary angiogram and uses contrast to show any blockages in the pulmonary vasculature. This is the definitive investigation to confirm PE.
-   V/Q scan – if CTPA is contraindicated
-   ABG – will hopefully show hypoxaemia with normo/hypocapnia, showing a ==type 1 respiratory failure== due to a V/Q mismatch.
	- Hypoxaemia  
	- low PaO2 and low PCO2
	- Widened A-a gradient – alveolar oxygen (ventilation) normal, but arterial oxygen is reduced. 
	- Respiratory alkylosis and hypocapnia – hyperventilation. This is a poor prognostic marker and a predictor of respiratory failure.  
- ECG – there are no specific signs on ECG for PE, but there are characteristic patterns that show right ventricular strain.  
	- ==***Sinus tachycardia***  ==
	- Non-specific ST and T wave changes – anterior leads 
	- Right bundle branch block – extreme right heart strain 
	- S1Q3T3



**WELLS SCORE (pre-test probability for PE):**

Score >6 = high probability
Score <2 = low probabililty

# Management
## Treatments for DVT

**Acute treatment for proimal DVT and PE**
 **Heparin (initial)**
 ==Apixaban 10 mg orally, or rivaroxaban 15mg orally twice daily for 7 days==

DVT treatment – anticoagulation is the mainstay of DVT treatment. It is indicated in all PROXIMAL DVT cases and SOME DISTAL DVT cases. The aim of treatment is to prevent extension of the clot, PE, recurrent clots.

-   Proximal DVT – popliteal, femoral, iliac. DEFINITELY ANTICOAG, even in the absence of symptoms!
-   Distal DVT – usually in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins.
   
Drugs – there is usually an initial anticoagulant that is used acutely, which is then usually transitioned to another anticoagulant that is to be used in the long term.
-   ==**Heparin (initial)== and warfarin (long term)** – since warfarin usually takes 1 week to come on, the initial LMWH covers this initial period (clexane)
-   ==Heparin (initial)== and NOAC (long term)
-   Monotherapy with NOAC

For patients with CKD (low GFR) - give apixaban or warfarin or unfractionated heparin
Thombolysis or surgical thombectomy 


## Treatments for PE
Haemodynamic stability – the necessary treatment for PE patients depends on this:
-   Haemodynamically unstable (massive PE) – these patients are usually in obstructive shock, with systolic blood pressure <90mmHg and tachycardic. These patients often progress to RHS heart failure
-   Haemodynamically stable – range small PEs with stable obs, to sub-massive PEs with borderline obs and progression to RHS heart failure.

Initial ED management:
-   Oxygen supplementation – aim for >90% SpO2 (saturation)
-   Haemodynamic support – especially indicated in patients who show signs of hypoperfusion, such as confusion, decreased urine output.  
	- 500 – 1000mL of saline should be used. However, too much fluids can also be harmful as it would exacerbate RHS heart failure.
  
## Haemodynamically stable PE treatment:
-   Empirical anticoagulation – according to the HAS-BLED score, low bleeding risk patients will need anticoagulation to prevent extension of the clot.  
	- ==Enoxaparin/clexane (LMWH) used initially.== NOACs can also be used.
	- NOACs or warfarin is used as a more long-term agent. Warfarin is better in renal failure patients and those with antiphospholipid syndrome
-   ==IVC filter== – is indicated in patients who have anticoagulation contraindicated
-   No thrombolysis


## Haemodynamically unstable PE (MASSIVE PE) treatment:
- ==Thrombolysis – use alteplase== or tenectaplase, which are recombinant tissue plasminogen activators.
- ![[Pasted image 20230508131456.png]]
-   ==Embolectomy== – indicated in patients who are contraindicated for thrombolysis or those in which thrombolysis was unsuccessful.
	- Catheter directed methods  
	- Surgical embolectomy – usually only done in large hospitals with experienced staff. High mortality, especially in the elderly.
- ==Anticoagulation== – if patient is successfully thrombolysed and becomes haemodynamically stable again.

# Complications
1. Death in large PE
2. Pullmonary HTN in small multiple PEs 
3. Stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale

<2 = DVT unlikely, 2-6 = likely, >6 = very likely
<4 PE unlikely, >4 PE likely
