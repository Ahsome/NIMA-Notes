# Information
 
*Pneumonia* is lung inflammation caused by bacterial or viral infection, in which air sacs fill with pus and may become solid

> [!Important]
- It is important to know the typical and atypical causes of community acquired pneumonia. See [[Pneumonia#^bb83b6]]
- First line investigation is *always* **CXR**. This is to differentiate with [[Bronchitis]], which has similar symptoms but does not need Abx ^484c71
- Patinets can be treated outpatient, in hospital, and in ICU. Steps on choosing the right decision are in [[Pneumonia#*Hospitalisation choice*:]]
- Patients treated outpatient require [[Pneumonia#*Low-severity treatment*]]. Patients hospitalised require [[Pneumonia#*Medium-severity treatment*]]. Patients in ICU require [[Pneumonia#*High-severity treatment*]]^efd571

## Pathophysiology
### *Community acquired pneumonia* (CAP):
Pneumonia acquired outside hospital, or within 72 hours of admission into the hospital. The following are the common bacterial causes:
| Typical     | Atypical   |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| S.Pneumonia | Mycoplasma |
| H.Influenza | Chlamydia  |
| S.Aureus    | Legionella (atypicals)           |

^bb83b6

### *Nosomcomial pneumonia*:
These are often caused by **Gram negatives** (*pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E. Coli*) or *Staph Aureus*

# Management
## Treatments
### *Acute management*
#### *Hospitalisation choice*:
Most patients can have CAP treated as outpatients. If so, treatment should follow low severity (see [[Pneumonia#*Low-severity treatment*]]) However, there are two main ways they should be hospitalised:
1. If the patient is Hypoxemic, **always hospitalise**
2. If their CRB-65 score is >= 1. See [[Pneumonia#*CURB65*]] for calculation and mortality
	1. If blood results are possible, use CURB-65. See [[Pneumonia#*CURB65*]]

Hospitalised patients should be treated with medium-severity treatment. See [[Pneumonia#*Medium-severity treatment*]] 

It's possible to use the SMART-COP score to identify if the patient needs ICU care in hospital See [[Pneumonia#*SMART-COP*:]] for calculation. These patients need [[Pneumonia#*High-severity treatment*]]

#### *Low-severity treatment*:
##### Monotherapy:
Treatment should occur over 5-7 days. If not improving, consider escalating to combination therapy (See [[Pneumonia#Combination therapy]]) and admission to hospital

For typical community acquired pneumonia
| Drug           | Dose          | Reasoning                                                |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amoxicillin    | 1g PO q8h     | Low severity, covers rise of *S.pneumo*                  |

For patients with suspected atypical community acquired pneumonia **OR** allergic to penicillin (choose one):
| Drug           | Dose          | Reasoning                                |     |     |

| Doxycyline     | 100mg PO q12h | Covers atypical pathogens                                |     |     |
| Clarithromycin | 500mg PO q12h | Use if allergic to doxycycline |     |     |

##### Combination therapy
For typical community acquired pneumonia
| Drug        | Dose       | Reasoning                               |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |

| Doxycycline | 100mg q12h | Covers atypical                                        |

If midly-moderately allergic to penicillin:
| Drug       | Dose          | Reasoning                      |     |     |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | --- | --- |
| Doxycyline | 100mg PO q12h | Covers atypical pathogens      |     |     |
| Cefuroxime | 500mg PO q12h | Use if allergic to doxycycline |     |     |

If severe allergy to penicillin:
| Drug         | Dose        | Reasoning                               |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Moxifloxacin | 400mg PO OD |  |

If midly allergic to Doxycycline
| Drug           | Dose          | Reasoning                      |     |     |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | --- | --- |
| Clarithromycin | 500mg PO w12h |                                |     |     |
| Cefuroxime     | 500mg PO q12h |  |     |     |

#### *Medium-severity treatment*
For moderate severity CAP, use a two-drug regime:
![[Pasted image 20230508144225.png]]

#### *High-severity treatment*
For high severity CAP, use a two-drug regime:
![[Pasted image 20230508144326.png]]

If the patient has *S. Aureus*, consider treatment of it knwoing the increased prevelance of MRSA:

Stop therapy with vancomycin if testing identifies a patient does not have *S.Aurueus*
