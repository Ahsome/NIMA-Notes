# Information
 
*Pneumonia* is lung inflammation caused by bacterial or viral infection, in which air sacs fill with pus and may become solid

> [!Important]
- It is important to know the typical and atypical causes of community acquired pneumonia. See [[Pneumonia#^bb83b6]]
- First line investigation is *always* **CXR**. This is to differentiate with [[Bronchitis]], which has similar symptoms but does not need Abx ^efd571

## Pathophysiology
### *Community acquired pneumonia* (CAP):
Pneumonia acquired outside hospital, or within 72 hours of admission into the hospital. The following are the common bacterial causes:
| Typical     | Atypical   |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| S.Pneumonia | Mycoplasma |
| H.Influenza | Chlamydia  |
| S.Aureus    | Legionella (atypicals)           |

^bb83b6

### *Nosomcomial pneumonia*:
These are often caused by **Gram negatives** (*pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E. Coli*) or *Staph Aureus*

## Signs
### *Symptoms*
#### Community Acquired Pneumonia
| Typical              | Atypical               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Fever                |                        |
| Cough                |                        |
| Dyspnea              |  |
| Pleuritic chest pain |                        |

### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
| Variant 1 | Variant 2 |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| - **Symptom 1** |     - Symptom 2               |

### *Questions to ask*
>*"Do you notice any fever? Cough?"*
>*"Do you have pain when you breath in?"

## Examination findings
| Key Findings  | Result                                                                                                              | Explanation |     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
| Consolidation | - Bronchial breath sounds<br>- Dullness to percussion<br>- Increased vocal resonance/fremitus<br>- Egophony present |             |     |
|               |                                                                                                                     |             |     |

You can differentiate this with [[Pleural Effusion]], which has similar findings:
| Pneumonia/Consolidation | Effusion                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Bronchial breath sounds | Decreased/absent breath sounds |
| Dullness to percussion  | Dullness to percussion         |
| Increased fremitus      | Decreased fremitus             |
| Egophony present        | Egophony present                               |

| Additional Findings         | Result    | Explanation |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Finding 1 | Result 1 | Explanation 1

## Investigations
| Key Tests | Result                                       | Explanation   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| CXR       | Lobe consolidation (Typical CAP) | - Diagnoses whether its Pneumonia<br>- Helps exclude [[Bronchitis]], which has similar symptoms but does not need abx<br>- Commonly Right Upper lobe |

| Additional Tests | Result                   | Explanation   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Sputum culture   | Test for bacterial cause | Not needed since Abx used are broad spectrum and cover most causes. See [[Pneumonia#^bb83b6]] for common causes |
