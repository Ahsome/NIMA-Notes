# Information
 
*Pneumonia* is lung inflammation caused by bacterial infection, in which air sacs fill with pus and may become solid

> [!Important]
- It is important to know the typical and atypical causes of community acquired pneumonia. See [[Pneumonia#^bb83b6]]
- First line investigation is *always* **CXR**. This is to differentiate with [[Bronchitis]], which has similar symptoms but does not need Abx ^484c71
- Patinets can be treated outpatient, in hospital, and in ICU. Steps on choosing the right decision are in [[Pneumonia#*Hospitalisation choice*:]]
- Patients treated outpatient require [[Pneumonia#*Low-severity treatment*]]. Patients hospitalised require [[Pneumonia#*Medium-severity treatment*]]. Patients in ICU require [[Pneumonia#*High-severity treatment*]]^efd571
- Repeat CXR should *only* be done 4-6 weeks, since it takes that long for resolution. Repeat 4-6 weeks if >50yo for malignancy ^02ef4d
- Recurrant pneumonia showcasing same area affected consistently should have a CT scan to eliminate malignancy, such as [[Lung cancer]]

## Pathophysiology
### *Community acquired pneumonia* (CAP):
^3f21f8
Pneumonia acquired outside hospital, or within 72 hours of admission into the hospital. It is also called *Lobar Pneumonia*, as it normally only affects the lobes. The following are the common bacterial causes:
| Typical     | Atypical               |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| S.Pneumonia | Mycoplasma             |
| H.Influenza | Chlamydia              | 
| S.Aureus    | Legionella (atypicals) |

^bb83b6

### *Nosomcomial pneumonia* (including HAP):
These are often caused by **Gram negatives** (*pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E. Coli*) or *Staph Aureus*
| Hospital-Acquired               | Ventilator-Acquired           | 
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Onset > 72hr of hospitalization | Onset >48hr after ventilation |

### *Recurrent pneumonia*:
This describes when pneumonia recurs quickly after being previously treated. The likely cause can be found on CXR:
1. If consolidation is on **different lung regions**, it is likely from Immunodeficiency (see [[HIV]], [[Cystic Fibrosis]])
2. If consolidation is in the **same lung region**, it can be an airway obstruction (e.g. *malignancy*) or [[Bronchiectasis]]
	1. The next best scan is a CT scan, to rule out malignancy
3. If consolidation recurrently occurs in the right middle/lower lobe, it is likely **aspiration** of stomach acid and microorganisms. See [[Pneumonia#Aspiration Pneumonia]]

### *Aspiration pneumonia*:
This is pneumonia due to aspiration of bacteria (commonly [[Med Notes/Diseases/Klebsiella]] or [[Staph. Aureus]]), normally from gastric contents. It has a slow-onset of symptoms over days, which can help differentiate between it and [[Pneumonitis]], which has an acute onset after witness aspiration

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Genera Pathogenesis | Irritation from aspiration of gastric acid | Aspiration of bacteria                                         |
| Clinical features   | Acute onset dyspnea and hypoxemia          | SLow onset of pneumonia in patient with spiration risk factors |
| Diagnosis           | Clinical                                   | X-Ray                                                           |
| Treatment           | Suctioning, oxygen                         | Antibiotics                                                               |

# Management
## Treatments
### *Acute management*
#### *Hospitalisation choice*:
Most patients can have CAP treated as outpatients. If so, treatment should follow low severity (see [[Pneumonia#*Low-severity treatment*]]) However, there are two main ways they should be hospitalised:
1. If the patient is Hypoxemic, **always hospitalise**
2. If their CRB-65 score is >= 1. See [[Pneumonia#*CURB65*]] for calculation and mortality
	1. If blood results are possible, use CURB-65. See [[Pneumonia#*CURB65*]]

Hospitalised patients should be treated with medium-severity treatment. See [[Pneumonia#*Medium-severity treatment*]] 

It's possible to use the SMART-COP score to identify if the patient needs ICU care in hospital See [[Pneumonia#*SMART-COP*:]] for calculation. These patients need [[Pneumonia#*High-severity treatment*]]

#### *Low-severity treatment*:
##### Monotherapy:
Treatment should occur over 5-7 days. If not improving, consider escalating to combination therapy (See [[Pneumonia#Combination therapy]]) and admission to hospital

For typical community acquired pneumonia
| Drug           | Dose          | Reasoning                                                |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amoxicillin    | 1g PO q8h     | Low severity, covers rise of *S.pneumo*                  |

For patients with suspected atypical community acquired pneumonia **OR** allergic to penicillin (choose one):
| Drug           | Dose          | Reasoning                                |     |     |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Doxycyline     | 100mg PO q12h | Covers atypical pathogens                                |     |     |
| Clarithromycin | 500mg PO q12h | Use if allergic to doxycycline |     |     |

##### Combination therapy
For typical community acquired pneumonia
| Drug        | Dose       | Reasoning                               |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |

| Doxycycline | 100mg q12h | Covers atypical                                        |

If midly-moderately allergic to penicillin:
| Drug       | Dose          | Reasoning                      |     |     |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | --- | --- |
| Doxycyline | 100mg PO q12h | Covers atypical pathogens      |     |     |
| Cefuroxime | 500mg PO q12h | Use if allergic to doxycycline |     |     |

If severe allergy to penicillin:
| Drug         | Dose        | Reasoning                               |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Moxifloxacin | 400mg PO OD |  |

If midly allergic to Doxycycline
| Drug           | Dose          | Reasoning                      |     |     |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | --- | --- |
| Clarithromycin | 500mg PO w12h |                                |     |     |
| Cefuroxime     | 500mg PO q12h |  |     |     |

#### *Medium-severity treatment*
For moderate severity CAP, use a two-drug regime:
![[Pasted image 20230508144225.png]]

#### *High-severity treatment*
For high severity CAP, use a two-drug regime:
![[Pasted image 20230508144326.png]]

If the patient has *S. Aureus*, consider treatment of it knwoing the increased prevelance of MRSA:
![[Pasted image 20230508144515.png]]

Stop therapy with vancomycin if testing identifies a patient does not have *S.Aurueus*

### *Follow-up management*
Follow up management should include secondary CXR after **4-6 weeks**. There should also be one 6-12 weeks later for patients >50yo. This is due to the fact that pneumonia in these patients can occur because of a malignancy. This can be hidden by the lobar pneumonia, but can be present after resolution

# Complications
1. A major complication of [[Pneumonia#*Aspiration pneumonia*:]] is a [[Lung Abscess]]. This will show as a contained, fluid-filled space in lungs with a "Air fluid level".
	1. It is predominantly by anaerobes, sometimes [[Staph. Aureus]] or [[Med Notes/Diseases/Klebsiella]]![[Pasted image 20230508205809.png]]
	2. This should be diagnosed via a CXR or CT scan, treated with broad spectrum antibiotics
