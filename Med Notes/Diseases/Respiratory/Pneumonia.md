# Information
 
*Pneumonia* is lung inflammation caused by bacterial or viral infection, in which air sacs fill with pus and may become solid

> [!Important]
- It is important to know the typical and atypical causes of community acquired pneumonia. See [[Pneumonia#^bb83b6]]
- First line investigation is *always* **CXR**. This is to differentiate with [[Bronchitis]], which has similar symptoms but does not need Abx ^efd571

## Pathophysiology
### *Community acquired pneumonia* (CAP):
Pneumonia acquired outside hospital, or within 72 hours of admission into the hospital. The following are the common bacterial causes:
| Typical     | Atypical   |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| S.Pneumonia | Mycoplasma |
| H.Influenza | Chlamydia  |
| S.Aureus    | Legionella (atypicals)           |

### *Nosomcomial pneumonia*:
These are often caused by **Gram negatives** (*pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E. Coli*) or *Staph Aureus*

| Fever                | Fever (milder)                |
| Cough                | Cough (milder)                |

| Pleuritic chest pain | Pleuritic chest pain (milder) |
|                      | Respiratory distress (rare)                              |

### *Risk factors*:
Risk factors include:
| Variant 1 | Variant 2 |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| - **Symptom 1** |     - Symptom 2               |

### *Questions to ask*
>*"Do you notice any fever? Cough?"*
>*"Do you have pain when you breath in?"
>*"Any history of ???"* See - [[Link to relavent article]]

## Examination findings

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
| Consolidation | - Bronchial breath sounds<br>- Dullness to percussion<br>- Increased vocal resonance/fremitus<br>- Egophony present |             |     |
|               |                                                                                                                     |             |     |

You can differentiate this with [[Pleural Effusion]], which has similar findings:
| Pneumonia/Consolidation | Effusion                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Bronchial breath sounds | Decreased/absent breath sounds |
| Dullness to percussion  | Dullness to percussion         |
| Increased fremitus      | Decreased fremitus             |
| Egophony present        | Egophony present                               |

# Management
## Treatments
### *Possible drugs:*
#### *Community Acquired Pneumonia*
Drugs have to cover *S. pneumo, H. flu, atypicals*

### *Acute issue*
#### *Hospitalisation choice*:
Most patients can have CAP treated as outpatients. However, there are two main ways:
1. If the patient is Hypoxemic, **always hospitalise**
2. If their CRB-65 score is >= 1. See [[Pneumonia#*CURB65*]] for calculation and mortality
	1. If blood results are possible, use CURB-65. See [[Pneumonia#*CURB65*]]

It's possible to use the SMART-COP score to identify if the patient needs ICU care in hospital See [[Pneumonia#*SMART-COP*:]] for calculation

### *Long-term issue*
Steps for manaing long-term:
1. Step 1

## Criteria
### *CRB-65*:
