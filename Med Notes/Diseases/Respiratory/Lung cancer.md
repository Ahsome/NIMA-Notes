# Information
Lung cancer is cancer involving lung tissue. It is the **most deadly** cancer, and *second* **most likely** cancer. 
It has usually advanced at presentation; it is unlikely to identify lung cancer in the earlier stages

More tumors of the lungs are *metastasis to lung*, rather than *primary lung tumors*. This leads to multiple lesions on imaging. Most comonly from:
1. [[Breast Cancer]]
2. Colon

It is important to identify other differentials for masses in the mediastinum. See [[Mediastinal Masses]]

---

## Subtypes
The main subtypes of [[Lung cancer]] can be split into two main categories:
1. [[#Small cell lung cancer]]
2. [[#Non-small cell lung cancer]]

### Small cell lung cancer
Small cell lung cancer occurs roughly 15% of time. It is rarely resectable (95% cases cannot), and has *poor* prognosis compared to [[#Non-small cell lung cancer]]. It is named after the small cells found on biopsy:
![[Pasted image 20230512202628.png]]

Features include:
1. It is fast growing, early metastasis.
2. It is treated with **chemotherapy**
3. Exhibitts *many* paraneoplastic syndromes.
4. It occurs in smokers
5. Risk of [[#^5de9bf|SVC syndrome]] due to compression of SVC

### Paraneoplastic Syndromes:
Small cell lung cancer can result in production of:
1. ACTH
	1. [[Cushing's Syndrome]]
	2. Progressive Obesity
	3. Hyperglycemia
2. ADH
	1. [[SIADH]]
	2. Hyponatremia
3. Antibodies
	1. Creayes antibodies against pre-synaptic Ca2+ channels in neurons
	2. Blocks Ach
	3. Lambert-Eaton syndrom

---

### Non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common (85%), and it *can* be resected. It has a better progrnosis compared to [[#Small cell lung cancer]]. It has three main types:
1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma
2. Adenocarcinoma
3. Large-cell Carcinoma

See [[#Comparisons]] for comparisons for each type

#### Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This occurs due to *hilar mass arising from bronchus*. It is common in **male smokers**.
Key pathologies include:
1. Keratin production ("pearls") by tuor cells
2. Intercellular desosomes ("intercellular bridges")

It can create PTHrP, leading to:
1. Hypercalcemia
2. Bone and abdominal pain, confusion

#### Adenocarcinoma
This is the most common lung cancer in non-smokers. It is a **glandular tumor**

#### Large Cell Carcinoma
Most rare [[#Non-small cell lung cancer]]. It is poorly differentiated, and lacks any glandular, small cell, or squamous diferentiation. It has a poor prognosis, affecting the periphery and involves smoking

---

### Pancoast tumor
Pancoast tumor is a tumor at the **apex of the lung**. it involves the *superior sulcus*, the groove formed b subclavian vessels
Symptoms include:
1. Arm adema on affected side
2. Shoulder pain
3. Arm paresthesia
4. Weakness
5. Horner's syndrome (due to sympathetic nerve copression)
		1. Miosis
		2. Ptosis
		3. Anhidrosis

> [!Important]
- Most deadly cancer, second most likely cancer
- When using CXR, always compare with previous CXR to identify new lesions ^fdb235
- [[#Adenocarcinoma]] is the cancer linked least to non-smoking
- Most lung cancer come from metastatis, such as from [[Breast Cancer]] and [[Colon Cancer]]
- When pulmonary nodules are found, always conduct management as seen in [[#Pulmonary Nodules:]] ^3290b8

--- 
# History
### Symptoms
1. Cough
2. Dyspnea
	1. Can be due to [[#^2032c7|Phrenic nerve compression]]
3. Hemoptosys
4. Weight loss
5. [[Pneumonia#*Recurrent pneumonia*:]]:
	1. Specifically, if under CXR it shows the pneumonia consistently affects the same region
	2. If migratory, then more likely to be an immune defiiency
	3. Best scan is CT scan
6. Hoarseness: Due to [[#^93ef83|recurrant laryngeal nerve compression]]
7. Symptoms from [[#Pancoast tumor]]:
	1. Arm edema
	2. Shoulder pain
	3. Arm paresthesia
	4. Weakness
	5. Horner's syndrome
		1. Miosis
		2. Ptosis
		3. Anhidrosis

# Management
## Overall treatment
Treatment involves the following:
1. Surgery:
	1. Discussion of whether to perform surgery
	2. Requires tap effusions to check for malignant pleural effusion
2. Chemotherapy
3. Radiation

Specific management is needed when identified from [[#^c3139a|Pulmonary Nodules]]

### Surgery:
Surgery is not incidated in:
1. Metastatic disease. This includes [[#Small cell lung cancer]], which are unresectable 95% time
2. Bilateral disease
3. Malignant pleural effusion

**NOTE**: Size is *not* a major determinant for surgery

![[Pasted image 20230512221323.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230512221653.png]]

### Medical therapy:
1. Chemotherapy: Indicated for most lung cancers, use [[Cisplastin]] plus a second agent like [[etoposide]]
2. Targeted therapy: Can use tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies depending on mutation type
	1. EGFR: EGFR TKI (osimertinib) or EGFR monoclonal (cetuximab)
	2. ALK: ALK TKI (alectinib)
	3. ROS1: Crizotinib
	4. BRAF: Dabrafenib + Trametinib
3. Radiation Therapy

### Pulmonary Nodules:
When pulmonary nodules are identified, following steps are warranted:
1. Perform detailed clinical evaluation
2. Check with previous CXR to see if nodules are new
3. CT scan to check size and location
4. Potential biopsy for differentials

Differentials include: <br>- Granuloma <br>- Hamartoma <br>- Malilgancy

The use of biopsy depends on the risk that the pulmonary nodules are *low-risk* or *high-risk*.
- If considered low-risk, consider serial image testing and biopsy when size grows.
- If high risk, biopsy immediately:

## Criteria
### Severity of Pulmonary Nodules:
|Low risk  |High Risk   |
|:-:|:-:|
|<40yo <br>Non-Smoker <br>Small lesions <1cm <br>Smooth borders <br>Calcifications |\>40yo <br>Smoker <br>Large lesions <br>Spiculated |

	1. ACTH
		1. [[Cushing's Syndrome]]
			1. Leads to Progressive Obesity
			2. Leads to Hyperglycemia
	2. ADH
		1. [[SIADH]]
			1. Leads to Hyponatremia
	3. Antibodies

3. Phrenic nerve compression: ^2032c7
	1. Leads to diaphragm paralysis
	2. Dyspnea
	3. Hemidiaphragm elevated on CXR
	4. Can be tested with Sniff test. Make patient sniff under imaging such as fluroscope, if hemidiaphargm does not elevate then phrenic nerve compression ^7f0231
4. Recurrent laryngeal nerve compression ^93ef83
	1. Hoarseness
5. SVC syndrome: Caused by any obstruction of blood through SVC, such as a malignant tumor ^5de9bf
	1. Other causes include: Lymphoma, Indwelling catheters, pacemaker wires
	2. Facial swelling or head fullness
	3. Arm swelling
	4. Increased ICP
		1. Leads to headaches, confusion coma
		2. Cranial artery rupture
	5. Treatment involves:
		1. Anticoag for thrombus
		2. Steroids (lymphoma)
		3. ChemoRadiation
