# Information
Lung cancer is cancer involving lung tissue. It is the **most deadly** cancer, and *second* **most likely** cancer. 
It has usually advanced at presentation; it is unlikely to identify lung cancer in the earlier stages

More tumors of the lungs are *metastasis to lung*, rather than *primary lung tumors*. This leads to multiple lesions on imaging. Most comonly from:
1. [[Breast Cancer]]
2. Colon

It is important to identify other differentials for masses in the mediastinum. See [[Mediastinal Masses]]

---

## Subtypes
### Small cell lung cancer
Small cell lung cancer occurs roughly 15% of time. It is rarely resectable (95% cases cannot), and has *poor* prognosis compared to [[#Non-small cell lung cancer]]. It is named after the small cells found on biopsy:
![[Pasted image 20230512202628.png]]

Features include:
1. It is fast growing, early metastasis.
2. It is treated with **chemotherapy**
3. Exhibitts *many* paraneoplastic syndromes.
4. It occurs in smokers
5. Risk of [[#^5de9bf|SVC syndrome]] due to compression of SVC

### Paraneoplastic Syndromes:
Small cell lung cancer can result in production of:
1. ACTH
	1. [[Cushing's Syndrome]]
	2. Progressive Obesity
	3. Hyperglycemia
2. ADH
	1. [[SIADH]]
	2. Hyponatremia
3. Antibodies
	1. Creayes antibodies against pre-synaptic Ca2+ channels in neurons
	2. Blocks Ach
	3. Lambert-Eaton syndrom

---

### Non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common (85%), and it *can* be resected. It has a better progrnosis compared to [[#Small cell lung cancer]]. It has three main types:
1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma
2. Adenocarcinoma
3. Large-cell Carcinoma

See [[#Comparisons]] for comparisons for each type

#### Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This occurs due to *hilar mass arising from bronchus*. It is common in **male smokers**.
Key pathologies include:
1. Keratin production ("pearls") by tuor cells
2. Intercellular desosomes ("intercellular bridges")

It can create PTHrP, leading to:
1. Hypercalcemia
2. Bone and abdominal pain, confusion

#### Adenocarcinoma
This is the most common lung cancer in non-smokers. It is a **glandular tumor**

#### Large Cell Carcinoma
Most rare [[#Non-small cell lung cancer]]. It is poorly differentiated, and lacks any glandular, small cell, or squamous diferentiation. It has a poor prognosis, affecting the periphery and involves smoking

---

### Pancoast tumor
Pancoast tumor is a tumor at the **apex of the lung**. it involves the *superior sulcus*, the groove formed b subclavian vessels
Symptoms include:
1. Arm adema on affected side
2. Shoulder pain
3. Arm paresthesia
4. Weakness
5. Horner's syndrome (due to sympathetic nerve copression)
		1. Miosis
		2. Ptosis
		3. Anhidrosis

> [!Important]
- Most deadly cancer, second most likely cancer
- When using CXR, always compare with previous CXR to identify new lesions ^fdb235
- [[#Adenocarcinoma]] is the cancer linked least to non-smoking
- Most lung cancer come from metastatis, such as from [[Breast Cancer]] and [[Colon Cancer]]
- When pulmonary nodules are found, always conduct management as seen in [[#Pulmonary Nodules:]] ^3290b8

--- 
# History
### Symptoms
1. Cough
2. Dyspnea
	1. Can be due to [[#^2032c7|Phrenic nerve compression]]
3. Hemoptosys
4. Weight loss
5. [[Pneumonia#*Recurrent pneumonia*:]]:
	1. Specifically, if under CXR it shows the pneumonia consistently affects the same region
	2. If migratory, then more likely to be an immune defiiency
	3. Best scan is CT scan
6. Hoarseness: Due to [[#^93ef83|recurrant laryngeal nerve compression]]
7. Symptoms from [[#Pancoast tumor]]:
	1. Arm edema
	2. Shoulder pain
	3. Arm paresthesia
	4. Weakness
	5. Horner's syndrome
		1. Miosis
		2. Ptosis
		3. Anhidrosis

# Management
## Overall treatment
Treatment involves the following:
1. Surgery:
	1. Discussion of whether to perform surgery
	2. Requires tap effusions to check for malignant pleural effusion
2. Chemotherapy
3. Radiation

Specific management is needed when identified from [[#^c3139a|Pulmonary Nodules]]

### Surgery:
Surgery is not incidated in:
1. Metastatic disease. This includes [[#Small cell lung cancer]], which are unresectable 95% time
2. Bilateral disease
3. Malignant pleural effusion

**NOTE**: Size is *not* a major determinant for surgery

![[Pasted image 20230512221323.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230512221653.png]]

### Medical therapy:
1. Chemotherapy: Indicated for most lung cancers, use [[Cisplastin]] plus a second agent like [[etoposide]]
2. Targeted therapy: Can use tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies depending on mutation type
	1. EGFR: EGFR TKI (osimertinib) or EGFR monoclonal (cetuximab)
	2. ALK: ALK TKI (alectinib)
	3. ROS1: Crizotinib
	4. BRAF: Dabrafenib + Trametinib
3. Radiation Therapy

### Pulmonary Nodules:
When pulmonary nodules are identified, following steps are warranted:
1. Perform detailed clinical evaluation
2. Check with previous CXR to see if nodules are new
3. CT scan to check size and location
4. Potential biopsy for differentials

Differentials include: <br>- Granuloma <br>- Hamartoma <br>- Malilgancy

The use of biopsy depends on the risk that the pulmonary nodules are *low-risk* or *high-risk*.
- If considered low-risk, consider serial image testing and biopsy when size grows.
- If high risk, biopsy immediately:

## Criteria
### Severity of Pulmonary Nodules:
|Low risk  |High Risk   |
|:-:|:-:|
|<40yo <br>Non-Smoker <br>Small lesions <1cm <br>Smooth borders <br>Calcifications |\>40yo <br>Smoker <br>Large lesions <br>Spiculated |

	2. Dyspnea
	3. Hemidiaphragm elevated on CXR
	4. Can be tested with Sniff test. Make patient sniff under imaging such as fluroscope, if hemidiaphargm does not elevate then phrenic nerve compression ^7f0231
4. Recurrent laryngeal nerve compression ^93ef83
	1. Hoarseness
5. SVC syndrome: Caused by any obstruction of blood through SVC, such as a malignant tumor ^5de9bf
	1. Other causes include: Lymphoma, Indwelling catheters, pacemaker wires
	2. Facial swelling or head fullness
	3. Arm swelling
	4. Increased ICP
		1. Leads to headaches, confusion coma
		2. Cranial artery rupture
