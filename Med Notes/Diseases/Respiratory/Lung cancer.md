# Information
Lung cancer is cancer involving lung tissue. It is the **most deadly** cancer, and *second* **most likely** cancer. 

It has usually advanced at presentation; it is unlikely to identify lung cancer in the earlier stages

## Subtypes
### Small cell lung cancer
Small cell lung cancer occurs roughly 15% of time. It is rarely resectable (95% cases cannot), and has *poor* prognosis compared to [[#Non-small cell lung cancer]]. It is named after the small cells found on biopsy:

It is fa

### Non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common (85%), and it *can* be resected. It has a better progrnosis compared to [[#Small cell lung cancer]]. It has three main types:
1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma
2. Adenocarcinoma
3. Large-cell Carcinoma

> [!Important]
- Most deadly cancer, second most likely cancer
- When using CXR, always compare with previous CXR to identify new lesions ^fdb235

# History
### Symptoms
1. Cough
2. Dyspnea
3. Hemoptosys
4. Weight loss
5. [[Pneumonia#*Recurrent pneumonia*:]]:
	1. Specifically, if under CXR it shows the pneumonia consistently affects the same region
	2. If migratory, then more likely to be an immune defiiency
	3. Best scan is CT scan

### Risk factors:
1. Ciagarette smoking
2. Radiation therapy
	1. Hodgkin lymphoma
	2. [[Breast Cancer]]
3. Environmental toxins
	1. Asbestos
	2. Radon
