# Information
Lung cancer is cancer involving lung tissue. It is the **most deadly** cancer, and *second* **most likely** cancer. 

It has usually advanced at presentation; it is unlikely to identify lung cancer in the earlier stages

## Subtypes
### Small cell lung cancer
Small cell lung cancer occurs roughly 15% of time. It is rarely resectable (95% cases cannot), and has *poor* prognosis compared to [[#Non-small cell lung cancer]]. It is named after the small cells found on biopsy:
![[Pasted image 20230512202628.png]]

Features include:
1. It is fast growing, early metastasis.
2. It is treated with **chemotherapy**
3. Exhibitts *many* paraneoplastic syndromes.
4. It occurs in smokers

### Paraneoplastic Syndromes:
Small cell lung cancer can result in production of:
1. ACTH
	1. [[Cushing Syndrome]]
	2. Progressive Obesity
	3. Hyperglycemia
2. ADH
	1. [[SIADH]]
	2. Hyponatremia
3. Antibodies
	1. Creayes antibodies against pre-synaptic Ca2+ channels in neurons
	2. Blocks Ach
	3. Lambert-Eaton syndrom

### Non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common (85%), and it *can* be resected. It has a better progrnosis compared to [[#Small cell lung cancer]]. It has three main types:
1. Squamous Cell Carcinoma
2. Adenocarcinoma
3. Large-cell Carcinoma

### Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This occurs due to *hilar mass arising from bronchus*. It is common in **male smokers**.
Key pathologies include:
1. Keratin production ("pearls") by tuor cells
2. Intercellular desosomes ("intercellular bridges")

It can creat PTHrP, leading to:
1. Hypercalcemia
2. Bone and abdominal pain, confusion


> [!Important]
- Most deadly cancer, second most likely cancer
- When using CXR, always compare with previous CXR to identify new lesions ^fdb235

# History
### Symptoms
1. Cough
2. Dyspnea
3. Hemoptosys
4. Weight loss
5. [[Pneumonia#*Recurrent pneumonia*:]]:
	1. Specifically, if under CXR it shows the pneumonia consistently affects the same region
	2. If migratory, then more likely to be an immune defiiency
	3. Best scan is CT scan

Symptoms across variants
| Symptoms     | [[#Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Pain         | Bone and Abdominal pain<br>Due to production of PTHrP |
| Neurological | Confusion<br>Due to production of PTHrP                                                      |

### Risk factors:
1. Cigarette smoking
	1. Leads to [[#Small cell lung cancer]] or [[#Squamous Cell Carcinoma]] for men
2. Radiation therapy
	1. Hodgkin lymphoma
	2. [[Breast Cancer]]
3. Environmental toxins
	1. Asbestos
	2. Radon
