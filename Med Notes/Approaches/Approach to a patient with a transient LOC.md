-   epidural hematoma (lucid interval)
    -   non-contrast CT head
-   seizure - generalized
    -   EEG
-   postural hypotension - hypoglycemia, dehydration, bradycardia, drug-induced
    -   lying, standing BP
    -   BGL
    -   urine dipstick
    - kidney function tests - dehydration --> AKI
-   syncope - vasovagal, orthostatic and cardiac (arrhythmogenic or structural causes eg aortic stenosis)
-   functional TLOC, narcolepsy
    -   sleep study
-   infection - meningitis, encephalitis
    -   FBC, LP, CRP
-   stroke, TIA , vertebrobasilar insufficiency
-   electrolyte disturbances - hyponatremia
    -   urea and electrolytes
-   intoxication
-   AFIB
    -   ECG
-   migraines
-   MRI, carotid duplex US, cervical XR
- MX:
	- Fluids, DVT prophylaxis, medication review (e.g. reducing the dosages of B-blockers), managing AKI
	- Longer-term = see if they have a carer at home
	- Manage diabetic complications
	- Manage HTN complications
	- Manage osteoporosis to prevent fractures if future falls 
	- Multidisciplinary team



1. [[Syncope (LOC)|Vasovagal syncope]]
	1. **Commonly pro-drome**
	2. Diaphresis
	3. Nausea
	4. Stress
	5. Standing in heat, long period of time
	6. Quick recovery
	7. Provide reassurances
	8. Carotid version:
		9. Occurs becasuse block of carotid can signal brain of hypertension, so lowers BP, causing syncope
2. [[Syncope (LOC)|Orthostatic syncope]]
	3. Due to sudden drop in pressure when standing
	4. **Has prodrome**
	5. Improves with fluid
	6. Risk factors:
		1. Hypovolumic, dehydrated
		2. Beta-blocked or alpha-blocked, reduces BP
		3. Autonomic conditions, such as Parkinson and Diabetes
			1. Important complications in autonomic section of diabetes
			2. Have to worry as often on anti-hypertensives for diabetes, but this increases chance of syncope
3. [[Syncope (LOC)|Cardiac syncope]]
	1. **NO PRO-DROME**
	2. Sometimes palpitations, chest pain
	3. Only kind that occurs supine
	4. Risk factors:
		1. Ischemia (VERYR ARE)
			1. Only if chest pain or ECG
		2. Arrhytmia
			1. Sinus brady, ab block, svt, vt, so do ECG & history
			2. ![[Pasted image 20230522004523.png]]
		3. Outflow obstructioon
			1. AS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
			2. Normally syncope with exertion, since LV cannot reduce CO when blockage to Aorta
			3. Murmur, since AS and hypertroph has systolic ehection murmur
			4. Echo
4. Stroke
5. Seizure
	1. Remember status epilepticus
		1. >5 minutes of continous seizures
		2. 2 or more, without recovery of consciousness
	2. Clues instead of syncope:
		1. Has aura, hich are simple seizures based on location in brain
		2. Tonic-clonic
		3. Tongue bititng
		4. Incontinence
		5. Post-ictal state
			1. Key distinction
	3. Tests:
		1. Blood
			1. Calcium sodium glucose
				1. electrolyte dysfunction or hypoglucose cause seizure
			2. FBC
			3. renal function
			4. LFT
			5. Check for systemic disease
		2. Toxicology screen
			1. For drugs
		3. ECG (cardiac syncope)
		4. Brain imaging
			1. Tumors
			2. Bleeding
		5. SOmetimes LP (meningitis)
		6. EEG
			1. Only after other tests fail
			2. 3hz spike for childhood absence epilepsy, treat with ethosuximide
			3. NO post-ical
6. Exclude mechanical fall, which did not have transient LOC before hitting ground
7. VERY RARE:
	1. [[Pulmonary Embolus]]
	2. [[Subarachnoid Hemorrhage]]
	3. [[Sepsis|Shock]]
	4. [[Atrial myxoma]]
