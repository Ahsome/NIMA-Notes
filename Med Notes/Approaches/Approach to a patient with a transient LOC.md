1. [[Syncope (LOC)|Vasovagal syncope]]
	1. **Commonly pro-drome**
	2. Diaphresis
	3. Nausea
	4. Stress
	5. Standing in heat, long period of time
	6. Quick recovery
	7. Provide reassurances
	8. Carotid version:
		9. Occurs becasuse block of carotid can signal brain of hypertension, so lowers BP, causing syncope
2. [[Syncope (LOC)|Orthostatic syncope]]
	3. Due to sudden drop in pressure when standing
	4. **Has prodrome**
	5. Improves with fluid
	6. Risk factors:
		1. Hypovolumic, dehydrated
		2. Beta-blocked or alpha-blocked, reduces BP
		3. Autonomic conditions, such as Parkinson and Diabetes
			1. Important complications in autonomic section of diabetes
			2. Have to worry as often on anti-hypertensives for diabetes, but this increases chance of syncope
3. [[Syncope (LOC)|Cardiac syncope]]
	1. **NO PRO-DROME**
	2. Sometimes palpitations, chest pain
	3. Only kind that occurs supine
	4. Risk factors:
		1. Ischemia (VERYR ARE)
			1. Only if chest pain or ECG
		2. Arrhytmia
			1. Sinus brady, ab block, svt, vt, so do ECG & history
			2. ![[Pasted image 20230522004523.png]]
		3. Outflow obstructioon
			1. AS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
			2. Normally syncope with exertion, since LV cannot reduce CO when blockage to Aorta
			3. Murmur, since AS and hypertroph has systolic ehection murmur
			4. Echo
4. Stroke
5. Seizure
	1. Clues instead of syncope:
		1. Tonic-clonic
		2. Tongue bititng
		3. Incontinence
		4. Post-ictal state
6. Exclude mechanical fall, which did not have transient LOC before hitting ground
7. VERY RARE:
	1. [[Pulmonary Embolus]]
	2. [[Subarachnoid Hemorrhage]]
	3. [[Sepsis|Shock]]
	4. [[Atrial myxoma]]
