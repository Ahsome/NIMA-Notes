# Scenario:
Look at the scenario and answer the questions as follows SCENARIO: Mr KS is a 58 year old man who presents to your GP practice for a ‘medical’ as requested by his employer. His major concern is that he has recently noticed painful feet bilaterally which he describes as a ‘burning pain’. He does not take any medications. He has no known medical issues but reports he has not seen a doctor for over 20 years. He is fatigued but otherwise feels well. He is a non-smoker but drinks at least 1-2 stubbies most nights. Physical examination BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 80/m regular. GCS 15. BMI is 38. He has slightly dry mucus membranes. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are unremarkable. Lower limb examination reveals absent pin prick sensation to mid-shin bilaterally. Ankle jerk reflexes are absent. Knee jerk reflexes are present. Vibration sense is absent at the first metatarsophalangeal joint and at the medial malleoli bilaterally. Power is 5/5 and symmetrical in all lower limb movements. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpable bilaterally. Upper limb neurological examination is unremarkable. Cranial nerve examination including fundoscopy is normal.

What is your initial management plan? 5. How would you manage your patient in the longer term? (may include further investigations)?

# Answer
## With investigation
1. The likely working diagnosis for this scenario is peripheral neuropathy. The burning pain in the feet, along with absent pin prick sensation, absent ankle jerk reflexes, and absent vibration sense, are indicative of sensory neuropathy. The most likely cause in this case is likely to be diabetic neuropathy, given the patient's high BMI, elevated glucose levels, and HbA1c of 10.5%. Other possible causes of peripheral neuropathy include alcohol abuse, vitamin deficiencies (particularly vitamin B12), certain medications, and other systemic diseases such as kidney disease or autoimmune conditions.

2. The investigations that would be ordered in this case include:
- Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c: These tests confirm the presence of diabetes and assess long-term glucose control.
- Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: This test is performed to evaluate the patient's glucose tolerance and assess for impaired glucose regulation or diabetes.
- Electrolyte panel (sodium and potassium): Helps assess the patient's electrolyte balance.
- Renal function tests (urea, creatinine, eGFR): These tests evaluate kidney function and can indicate the presence of kidney disease.
- Additional investigations that may be considered depending on the clinical suspicion and further history include vitamin B12 levels, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and autoimmune markers.

3. Interpreting the investigations:
- Sodium: Within the normal range.
- Potassium: Within the normal range.
- Urea: Slightly elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.
- Creatinine: Elevated, further suggesting impaired kidney function.
- eGFR: Below normal range, indicating reduced kidney function.
- Glucose: Fasting and post-glucose load levels are elevated, confirming the presence of diabetes.
- HbA1c: High level indicates poor long-term glucose control.

4. The initial management plan for this patient would include:
- Referring the patient to an endocrinologist or diabetologist for comprehensive diabetes management.
- Education regarding lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, regular exercise, and dietary changes to control blood sugar levels.
- Initiating pharmacological treatment for diabetes, such as metformin or other appropriate medications, as determined by the specialist.
- Screening for complications associated with diabetes, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease, and addressing any identified issues.

5. In the longer term, the management of the patient would involve:
- Regular follow-up with the endocrinologist or diabetologist to monitor blood sugar control and adjust treatment as needed.
- Ongoing education and support regarding self-management of diabetes, including glucose monitoring, medication adherence, and lifestyle modifications.
- Screening and management of diabetes-related complications, including regular eye exams, kidney function monitoring, and cardiovascular risk assessment.
- Further investigations and referrals as necessary, such as nerve conduction studies or electromyography to assess the extent and severity of peripheral neuropathy, and consultation with a neurologist if needed.

It's important to note that the management plan should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and may vary based on their specific circumstances and additional findings during the course of evaluation and treatment.

## Without investigation
1. The likely working diagnosis for this scenario is peripheral neuropathy. The burning pain, absent pin prick sensation, absent ankle jerk reflexes, and absent vibration sense in the lower limbs are suggestive of peripheral nerve involvement. The possible causes for this condition include:
- Diabetes mellitus: Diabetic neuropathy is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy.
- Alcohol abuse: Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to alcoholic neuropathy.
- Vitamin deficiencies: Deficiencies in vitamins B12, B6, and E can cause peripheral neuropathy.
- Hypertension: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can contribute to peripheral nerve damage.
- Obesity: Excessive weight and high BMI may increase the risk of peripheral neuropathy.
- Other possible causes could include autoimmune disorders, infections, medication side effects, and certain inherited conditions.

2. The investigations that would be ordered in this case may include:
- Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c: To assess for diabetes mellitus as a potential cause.
- Complete blood count (CBC): To check for anemia or signs of infection.
- Vitamin B12 and folate levels: To evaluate for vitamin deficiencies.
- Liver function tests: To assess liver health, especially if alcohol abuse is suspected.
- Lipid profile: To evaluate lipid levels and cardiovascular risk factors.
- Thyroid function tests: To rule out thyroid dysfunction.
- Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG): To assess the severity and distribution of peripheral nerve damage.
- Urinalysis: To check for signs of kidney dysfunction or urinary tract infection.
- Other investigations may be ordered based on clinical suspicion and further evaluation.

3. The missing question.

4. The initial management plan for this patient may include:
- Lifestyle modifications: Advising the patient to stop or reduce alcohol consumption, implement a balanced diet, and encourage regular exercise to manage obesity and improve overall health.
- Pain management: Prescribing analgesic medications to alleviate the burning pain.
- Blood pressure control: Initiating antihypertensive treatment to manage the elevated blood pressure.
- Referral to a specialist: Considering a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and management of peripheral neuropathy.
- Education and follow-up: Providing information about the condition, its potential causes, and the importance of regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust the management plan if needed.

5. In the longer term, the management of this patient with peripheral neuropathy may include:
- Identifying and treating the underlying cause: If a specific cause is identified (e.g., diabetes), optimizing the management of that condition to prevent further progression of peripheral neuropathy.
- Symptom management: Continuously assessing and managing pain and discomfort associated with peripheral neuropathy through the use of medications such as analgesics or other agents specifically targeting neuropathic pain.
- Regular monitoring: Monitoring the patient's blood glucose levels (if diabetic), blood pressure, lipid profile, and other relevant parameters to optimize overall health and prevent complications.
- Nutritional support: Addressing any identified vitamin deficiencies through appropriate supplementation or dietary changes.
- Physiotherapy and occupational therapy: Recommending exercises, physical therapy, and assistive devices to maintain strength, mobility, and functionality.
- Referral for further investigations: If the underlying cause remains uncertain or if there is a need for more extensive evaluation, additional investigations such as genetic testing or nerve biopsies may be considered in consultation with a specialist.

It's important to note that the management plan should be individualized based on the specific needs and circumstances of the patient, and regular follow-up visits should be scheduled to assess the response to treatment and adjust the management approach as necessary.
