## Differentials:
### Must consider:
First consider important emergent causes:

**Cardiac**
1. [[Coronary Artery Disease#STEMI]]
	1. ST elevations, two contiguous leads
2. [[Coronary Artery Disease#NSTEMI]]
	1. Lack of ST elevations
	2. Angina in the presence of elevated biomarkers
3. [[Coronary Artery Disease#Unstable angina]]
	1. Angina in the presence of normal biomarkers
4. [[Aortic Dissection]]
	1. Hypertensive
	2. Tearing pain, radiating to the back
	3. CXR for widened mediastinum, need CT A to confirm diagnosis
5. [[Cardiac Tamponade]]
	1. Symptom:
	2. Test:
		1. Electric alternans
		2. Low voltage ECG
		3. Pulsus paradoxes
		4. Stat echo
6. [[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy]]
	1. ST elevations in anterior precordial leads, mimicking LAD stemi
	2. Eliminate other options

**Pulmonary**
6. [[Pulmonary Embolus]]
	1. Sign:
		1. Pleuritic chest pain
		2. Sinus tachycardia
		3. SOB
		4. New oxygen requirement
		5. Tachypnea
		6. Hemoptysis, if large embolus
		7. Long term immobility, such as car ride or plane ride
		8. JVP 
		9. Wells criteria
7. [[Pneumothorax]]
	1. Sign:
		1. Recent lung surgery
		2. Simple line insertion
	2. Examination:
		1. Unequal breath sounds
		2. Increased percussion

**GI**
- [[Esophageal Rupture]]
	- After persistent vomitting
	- Endoscopy
- [[Esophageal Impactation]]
	- Before ingestion of foreign objects
	- Endoscopy

Then break down into superficial and visceral causes:
**Superficial**
- Costochondritis
- Rib fracture
- Herpes Zoster
- Thoracic radiculopathy

**Visceral**
GI:
- Spasm
- Reflux
- Ulcers

Cardiac:
- Heart failure
- Aortic stenosis

Pulmonary:
- Pneumonia
- Diaphragmatic hernia

Mediastinum:
- Fat necrosis

## Tests:
1. ECG - **Best first test**, used to evaluate [[Coronary Artery Disease#STEMI]]
2. CT scan ([[Pulmonary Embolus]] or [[Aortic Dissection]])
3. Cardiac biomarkers ([[Coronary Artery Disease#NSTEMI]])
4. D-dimer
