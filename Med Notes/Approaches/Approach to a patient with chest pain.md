## Differentials:
### Must consider:
First consider important emergent causes:

**Cardiac**
1. [[Coronary Artery Disease#STEMI]]
	1. ST elevations, two contiguous leads
2. [[Coronary Artery Disease#NSTEMI]]
	1. Lack of ST elevations
	2. Angina in the presence of elevated biomarkers
3. [[Coronary Artery Disease#Unstable angina]]
	1. Angina in the presence of normal biomarkers
4. [[Aortic Dissection]]
	1. Hypertensive
	2. Tearing pain, radiating to the back
	3. CXR for widened mediastinum, need CT A to confirm diagnosis
5. [[Cardiac Tamponade]]
	1. Caued by pericardia effusions
		1. Only small amounts of fluid needed if in acute setting to cause tmaponade, such as bleeding
		2. If chronic, such as cancer, need large amount since heart adapts
	2. Symptom:
		1. PRessure from outside prevents ventricles filling in diastole
	3. Test:
		1. Electric alternans
		2. Distant, muffled heart sounds due to fluid in heart
		3. Dyspnea despite absence of pulmonary edema (no bilateral crackles)
		4. Elevated JVP since pressure prevents proper dilatation
		5. Low voltage ECG
		6. Pulsus paradoxes
			1. Normal patient, BP falls slightly on inspiration
			2. If exaggerated fall (>10 mmHg) = pulsus paradoxus
			3. Severe fall, pulse dissapears
			4. Also seen in asthma and COPD
				1. Inspiration decreases left sided flow of blood
				2. Exaggerated in lung disease
		7. Stat echo
		8. Water bottle sign: Note this means pericardial effusion, not specifically tamponade
		9. ![[Pasted image 20230523015013.png]]
6. [[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy]]
	1. ST elevations in anterior precordial leads, mimicking LAD stemi
	2. Eliminate other options

**Pulmonary**
6. [[Pulmonary Embolus]]
	1. Sign:
		1. Pleuritic chest pain
		2. Sinus tachycardia
		3. SOB
		4. New oxygen requirement
		5. Tachypnea
		6. Hemoptysis, if large embolus
		7. Long term immobility, such as car ride or plane ride
		8. JVP increase, due to right sided [[Heart Failure]]
		9. Wells criteria
		10. ABG (not needed) shows:
			1. decrease PaO2 - V/Q mismatch
			2. decrease PaCO2 - Hyperventilatiion
			3. Resp alkalosis due
		11. ECG:
			1. Most common, sinus tachy
			2. Can see S1Q3T3
		12. If cannot do CTPA ue to pregnancy or [[Chronic Kidney Disease]], do VQ scn
7. [[Pneumothorax]]
	1. Sign:
		1. Recent lung surgery
		2. Simple line insertion
	2. Examination:
		1. Unequal breath sounds
		2. Increased percussion

**GI**
- [[Esophageal Rupture]]
	- After persistent vomitting
	- Endoscopy
- [[Esophageal Impactation]]
	- Before ingestion of foreign objects
	- Endoscopy

Then break down into superficial and visceral causes:
**Superficial**
- Costochondritis
- Rib fracture
- Herpes Zoster
- Thoracic radiculopathy

**Visceral**
GI:
- Spasm
- Reflux
- Ulcers

Cardiac:
- Heart failure
- Aortic stenosis
- Pericarditis
	- Fever
	- Sharp, pleuritic chest pain
	- Worse lying down, better sitting up
	- Exam:
		- Pericardia friction rub, scratchy in systole and distole, only someties
	- Has diffuse ST-elevations, and PR depression:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230523014222.png]]
	- Increased WBC
	- Always do echo to find effusion, which can cause tamponade
	- Normally after infection, normally through viral
	- Also due to uremia from renal failure, treatment is hemodialysis (NOT DRUGS)
	- Treatment:
		- NSAIDS
		- Glucocorticoids, second line
		- Colchicine (inhibits WBCs via complex mechanism)
		- Normay NSAID plus colchicine

Pulmonary:
- Pneumonia
- Diaphragmatic hernia

Mediastinum:
- Fat necrosis

## Tests:
1. ECG - **Best first test**, used to evaluate [[Coronary Artery Disease#STEMI]]
2. CT scan ([[Pulmonary Embolus]] or [[Aortic Dissection]])
3. Cardiac biomarkers ([[Coronary Artery Disease#NSTEMI]])
4. D-dimer
