## Differentials:
### Must consider:
**Cardiac**
1. [[Coronary Artery Disease#STEMI]]
	1. ST elevations, two contiguous leads
2. [[Coronary Artery Disease#NSTEMI]]
	1. Lack of ST elevations
	2. Angina in the presence of elevated biomarkers
3. [[Coronary Artery Disease#Unstable angina]]
	1. Angina in the presence of normal biomarkers
4. [[Aortic Dissection]]
	1. Hypertensive
	2. Tearing pain, radiating to the back
5. [[Cardiac Tamponade]]
6. [[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy]]

**Pulmonary**
6. [[Pulmonary Embolus]]
7. [[Pneumothorax]]

**GI**
- [[Esophageal Rupture]]
- [[Esophageal Impactation]]

## Tests:
1. ECG - **Best first test**, used to evaluate [[Coronary Artery Disease#STEMI]]
2. CT scan ([[Pulmonary Embolus]] or [[Aortic Dissection]])
3. Cardiac biomarkers ([[Coronary Artery Disease#NSTEMI]])
4. D-dimer
