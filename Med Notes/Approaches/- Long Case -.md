## Overall:
- Structure for presenting information with categories:
	- e.g. [[Diabetes Mellitus]], talk about micro, macro and autonomic issues
	- e.g. [[Falls]], talk about intrinsic falls, extrinsic falls, mechanical fall
- Don't use too many abbreviations
- Don't use vague terms e.g. "fluid overload" - say something more conccrete like decompensated heart failure or pullmonary hypertension
- Don't say too much information - keep it succinct 


### Summary
- Key PMHx, risk factors, interesting social points (e.g. farmer, Indigenous)
- In conclusion, talk about independency / rural isolation, etc.
- Don't use too many colloquialisms e.g. their compliance is either good or bad, cannot be "reasonable"


## HPC:
- History-taking was impaired as the patient was a poor historian / intoxicated, so I would want to achieve a collateral history from family or from the medical chart 
- If chronic issue, why presenting now than before?
- Use headings with each section
- "On presentation to the hospital, the patient describes he has a CXR, ECG, etc.... performed "
	- He has been worked up by the cardiologist where there implication was decompensated heart failure
- "He is currently being managed with __ while in hospital for his fluid overload"
- "On a systems review......"


### PMHx:
- Don't use the term PMHx, use "Medical history" or "medical background"
- Keep relevant items together e.g. no family history of seizure when tallking about medical history
- Remember to ask about past STIs or sexual history 


### FHx:
- Keep it brief if the patient is old and it is not relevant
- Bring it up if patient is young and it is relevant 


## SHx:
- Ask impact of current PC on every aspect of social SHX
	- Can discuss impact of disease and management in issues
- How many stairs do the have at front/back and internal
- ADLs - ask if patient can shower, go to toilet, do their finances, etc. 


### Examination
- Start with the most relevant system first e.g. seizure do a neuro eam first, then cardio after
- Check for IV fluids, IDC in situ etc.
- "To complete my GI exam, i was do a genital exam (e.g. to check for STIs)"
- Neuro - do cranial nerve (intact), UL and LL and diabetic foot (monofilament)
- Thyroid exam for cardio DDx could be good


### Issues
- First issue = manage current PC
- Second issue = what the patient states as their number 1 goal
	- Ask them specifically why this is the most importnt e.g. diabetic neuropathy have you had concerns for falls in the past?
- Nerve conduction studies for neuropathy
