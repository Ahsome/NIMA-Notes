## Overall:
- Structure for presenting information with categories:
	- e.g. [[Diabetes Mellitus]], talk about micro, macro and autonomic issues
	- e.g. [[Falls]], talk about intrinsic falls, extrinsic falls, mechanical fall


### Summary
- Key PMHx, risk factors, interesting social points (e.g. farmer, Indigenous)


## HPC:
- History-taking was impaired as the patient was a poor historian / intoxicated, so I would want to achieve a collateral history from family or from the medical chart 
- If chronic issue, why presenting now than before?
- Use headings with each section

### PMHx:
- Don't use the term PMHx, use "Medical history"
- Keep relevant items together e.g. no family history of seizure when tallking about medical history
- Remember to ask about past STIs or sexual history 

## SHx:
- Ask impact of current PC on every aspect of social SHX
	- Can discuss impact of disease and management in issues
- ADLs - ask if patient can shower, go to toilet, do their finances, etc. 

### Examination
- Start with the most relevant system first e.g. seizure do a neuro eam first, then cardio after
- "To complete my GI exam, i was do a genital exam (e.g. to check for STIs)"
