### General Advice
1. Always explain why your provisional diagnosis is your number one 

### Investigations
1. Check vitals - are they super sick or not? Shock?
2. FBC - troponins, Hb, WCC, RBC, oeosinpphils (asthma +IgE)
3. TFTs
4. Beta HCG if chance of pregnancy 
5. Wound swab e.g. if the foot has fungus (tinea) and is cracked - chance of bacterial entry through there 
6. Joint aspirate 
7. LFTs, know them well
8. Urine dipstick, urinalysis (casts, osmolarity), urine M/C/S
9. STI screen and serology
10. Hepatitis serology 
11. Pulmonary function tests
12. Serum lactate - sepsis

### Management
1. Admit the patient 
2. Consult with cardio / neuro / etc.
3. Analgesia 
4. CURB-65 for admission for pneumonia 
5. Prevent complications:
	1. Perform immediate ABCDE management and resuscitation of unwell patients.
	2. Routine bloods, repeat troponins 
6. Try to state they have a specific plan, such as a COPD plan or Asthma plan for the disease
7. Prevent complications:
	1. DVT prophylaxis, both mechanical and/or chemical
	2. Mobilisation, deep breathing exercises or incentive spirometry to prevent HAP
	3. Movicol and/or ondansetron for N/V or constipation iif they are sick or dry
8. For respiratory diseases, recommend the annual flu and pneomoccal vaccine, and repeat CXR 4-6 weeks after 
9. Benpen for erysipelas, fluclox for celllulitis 

### Longer-term
1. Always try to do non-pharmacological approach first
	1. MDT team - dietician, physio, OT, speech path.
2. If patient hasn't been to the GP in many years, do a general screening test - lipids, cholesterol, HbA1c, dentition, etc.
3. "..... ACTION PLAN"
4. Always mention the chronic long-term problems at the end - diabetes, obesity management, COPD 
-   Lifestyle modifications: Encouraging the patient to make necessary changes in diet, exercise, weight management, and smoking cessation (if applicable) to reduce cardiovascular risk factors.
-   Optimization of medical therapy: Adjusting medications to control hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, as well as ensuring optimal glycemic control.
-   Cardiac rehabilitation: Referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve exercise capacity and promote long-term cardiovascular health.
-   Regular follow-up visits: Monitoring the patient's symptoms, medication adherence, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid profile at regular intervals.
-   Patient education: Providing information about the signs and symptoms of angina and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention if they occur.
- Optimise nutritional support- dietician
- Family planning and counselling if cancer 
- Driving risks 

My provisional diagnosis is an ACS, but given the scarce findings, I am hesistant to differentiate between an angina, STEMI and NSTEMI, and this will direct my investigations moving forwards.

At the bedside i would do vitals, urinary catheter, 12-lead ECG
