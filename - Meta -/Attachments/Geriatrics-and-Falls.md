Case:
90y lady, found from floor. She tripped and fell, hitting her wrist and her head, on the floor for one hour:
- 130/80, 96%, HR 90
- Laceration on head
- Not sure what happened but ended up on floor
- Denies cardiac issues, infective issues, or neurological issues, loss of consciousness
- PMH: Hypertension, IHD, anxiety, osteoarthrtiis
- SH: Non-smoker, non-drinker, lives her own home


**Notes:**
- Definition: Unintentional event of a patient resting on the ground or floor or other lower level
- Note it can be with LOC or not

Approach?
- What happened before, during, and after fall
- Did you feel faint, flush, sweaty
- Did you wake up on ground
- Did you trip/lose balance
- Vertigo?
- Slow or fast fall
- Where did you catch yourself? DId you hit your head?
- Could you get up by yourself?
- **Have you fallen before**
- Chest pain?

Intrinsic vs extrinsic factors:
- Intrinsic
	- MEdical and neuropsychiatric conditions
	- Impaired vision and hearing
	- Age-related neuro function, gait, postural reflexes
- Extrinsic
	- Medications
	- Improper prescription
	- FOotware
	- Environmental hazards

Important to know fall:
- Previous fall is strongest predictor of future fall

Examination:
- Aspirin, hit head, neurological system so changes in GCS
- IHD, so check her heart, plus, listen to lungs (resp cause)
- Obvious abbraisions
- MSK deformities, fractures
- Peripheral neuropothy
- Fell on wrist: Likely distal radius fracture, gives hint that no LOC

Investigations:
- ECG, cardiac causes
- Urinalysis older lady, UTI
- FBC (anemia, infection). CHEM20 (renal function, LFT, coag)
- CT non-con for bleeding risk, intracranial
	- Do with older person + head strike (65yo>)
	- Low GCS
	- On current anticoagulant
- X-ray: Wrist
- Vitamin D and CK

Diagnosis:
- Multifactorial fall, due

Initial management:
- Pain relief and management of wrist
- PT: FOr current level of functioning, exercising, seeing what extra movement the patient can have
- OT: For living condition at home, how that can be adjusted for her, to prevent falls, slips, trips etc
- Dietician: Patient could be malnourished, exacerbating her osteoperosis
- Medication review

Medication:
- Codeine: Cause constipation
- Movicol: Minor dehydration
- Statin can cause rhabdomyolisis

COmplications of falls:
- Sustained injuries, head injuries
- Rhabdomyolis, dehydration, AKI if left
- Admission: Deconditioning, increased risk of pneumonia
- Broken hip: High mortality, issues, require rehab
- Effects of confidence

Most common feature sites:
- WHere you land: Fracture of hands and head
- Weight-bearing joints: Hip-joint, knee-joint (Neck of femur)
- Vertebral fracture

Treatment of osteoporosis:
- bIsphosphonate (oral vs injection), vitamin D supplementations, encourage weight-bearing exercise, denosumab, raloxefine, teriparatide, romosozumab
- Non-pharma: Management of chronic disease, stop alcohol, good nutrition

Fall prevention strategies:
- OT, look for mechanical hazards, minimise trip hazards
- If orthostatic: Have hydration, go up slowly
- Use visual and mobile aids when walking
- Fall alarms
- Extra-care options, residential age care
- Exercise: Weight-bearing exercise, and helps with balance
- Podiatry foot care and foot wear
- Consider DEXA-scan post discharge, can affect review of medications and bisphosphonates
