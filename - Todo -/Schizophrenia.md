- Psychosis is a symptom and has four pillars:
	- delusions - fixed false beliefs that are impermeable to change
	- hallucinations - sensory perception in the absence of stimulus
	- catatonic - motor component e.g. psychological pillow, not willing to cooperate, incontinence 
	- disorganisation of thinking (speech) or behaviour 
- Risk factors
	- drug-use e.g. stimulants
	- 60% cause is genetic - chromosomal defect in the neuronal pruning process 
- Schizophrenia is diagnosed by:
	- >6 months of
	- Positive symptoms e.g. delusions, hallucinations or both
	- Negative symptoms e.g. poverty of thought, amotivation
	- Cognitive symptoms
	- rule out other causes e.g. medications or drugs or delirium or autism 
- Dopamine hypothesis - all antipsychotics are dopamine antagonists and they best target the positive symptoms
