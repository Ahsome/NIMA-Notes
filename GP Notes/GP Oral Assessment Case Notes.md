## If TERMINATION

4. Shared management plan negotiation
- Can terminate <22 weeks upon request
	- after that, need to get approval from another doctor to review
- Pre-termination care
	- ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t_CDN2Kc2r96mnxCTtbZyIq4GF-JlHD3Ww1eYKKEug13hvNRRYRaNIdwHCxuS_WXU4EZdDhLDGPtDz0kqBD6bqcOqucB10ud-EBvXHQVKKNHd6sLOugEBZibbfvtkmJ0T4jHDXanHlVezO9L16KLIzk)
	- Urine pregnancy test, USS
- Termination
	- If <63 days (9 weeks), can use medical termination w MS-2 step
	- Do NOT give MS-2step if ectopic, IUD in situ, >63 days, no USS confirmation, allergies, chronic adrenal failure, on steroids, hypocoagulable, anticoagulated, allergic to prostaglandins, not consent
	- ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UisyfDFtm3JLz_khaqdQtr5HtwUz31EpdihiWDHG90BSB2wnQUmqrQv0KYJoCjcx_Q_z7h6OUaw5Qx3VECU9OsGW4kJwr8BuR4wxC9aDMZM5rOH_LSoEJ0aseq_psG_Nu9Bg3ADwgsCRUuMiF6CPb1M)
	- **Mifepristone and Misoprostol**
	- The usual dose of mifepristone is 200 mg  (one tablet) in the green box. Take the misoprostol tablets, usually 36 to 48 hours later. It is necessary totake the mifepristone tablet first and then, 36 to 48 hours later, take the misoprostol tablets. This must be done in this order for the medicines to work. 
	- It is recommended that the mifepristone tablet should be taken on an empty stomach - 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal.  
	- Vaginal bleeding usually starts 1 to 2 days after taking the mifepristone tablet. 36 to 48 hours after taking the mifepristone tablet you need to take misoprostol tablets as directed by your doctor or given to you by medical staff. After you take misoprostol tablets, you should stay at home and rest for 3 hours. Some women may be at a clinic for this part of the treatment. Vaginal bleeding will usually occur and the pregnancy may be expelled within a few hours of taking misoprostol or during the next few days. The bleeding lasts on average for 10 to 16 days and may be heavy

5. Preventative opportunities
- I know this can be a very emotional time - how is your mental health?
- Contraception going forward - need within 5 days, but if we want pill, should start soonish bc takes 7 days to be covered

6. Other chronic problems
- How’s the asthma? Note that you’re not on any medications - have you had any sx?
- Have you ever thought about smoking cessation?

7. Summarise plan, any questions?
8. Take-away info
- Flyer from Marie Stopes

9. Safety net
- If no bleeding within 24 hours, call our practice
- If feeling unwell, excessive nausea, excessive bleeding (more than 2 pads per hour), symptoms after more than a day, ongoing abdo pain, weakness, fever → present to ED or us

10. Follow-up
- 2-3 weeks after MS-2 step

## If DV

- Is there anyone else at home at risk of violence (e.g. kids)?
- Have you been physically injured? Have you been hospitalised?
- Has the frequency and severity of the violence increased?
- How are you coping in terms of your mental health?
- I think we should book a long appt for a mental health care plan
- I think we should book a long appt for safety planning
	- ‘Where will you go in an emergency and who will come (eg children)?’  
	- ‘How will you get there?’  
	- ‘Which friends, family or neighbours can be contacted in an emergency?’  
	- Hide money and an extra set of house and car keys.  
	- Establish code words or code clothing colour to signal that you need help.  
	- Remove any weapons from house.  
	- Ensure you have quick access to the following:  
		- money  
		- Medicare and tax file numbers  
		- rent and utility receipts o birth certificates (or copies) for you and children  
		- ID and/or driver’s licence for you and children  
		- bank account and insurance policy numbers  
		- marriage certificate 
		- valuable items like jewellery  
		- hidden bag with extra clothing and other essential items.  
	- Ensure important phone numbers and documents are stored in a safe place
	- Obtain a new phone that the perpetrator has no knowledge of so you are untraceable. May need to be hidden with other objects.
- In the meantime, 000 if unsafe, and 1800 RESPECT

Murtaugh’s 10 step management plan:
1. Shared agenda
- Migraine management
- COCP

2. Patient ideas, concerns, expectations

3. Info and education provision
- Migraine - headache related to changes to blood supply & excessive activation of pain receptors in nerves of brain

4. Shared management plan negotiation
- Migraine management
	- Prophylaxis
		- Avoid triggers - bright lights, noises for you
		- Regular sleep, exercise, healthy diet, appropriate hydration
		- Avoid stress - how is mental health?
		- Relaxation techniques can be helpful - Migraine Australia, calm, smiling mind
		- Some people find acupuncture helpful - moderate quality evidence
		- Not indicated for pharmacological prophylaxis
			- (>2 attacks/week, >2 attacks per month causing >3 days of disability, significantly disabling sx)  
				*General prophylaxis  
				First-line  
				Anticonvulsants (e.g., topiramate, valproate)  
				Beta blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol, timolol)  
				Second-line  
				Tricyclic antidepressant: amitriptyline  
				NSAIDs: fenoprofen  
				Other: calcium channel blockers (e.g., flunarizine)*
	- Headache diary
	- Abortive
		- Pharmacological
			- NSAIDS/paracetamol/aspirin
			- Sumatriptan - 50-100mg orally, wait 2 hours before repeating dose, max 300mg daily → take at first sign of migraine (even aura)
			- Ondansetron - 4-8mg orally, max daily dose 16mg PRN
	- Supportive
		- Cold packs/warm packs
		- Dark room
		- Resting → anything we can do to help with kids? Babysitter, neighbour, friends/local mums group or day care centre
		- Neck stretching
		- Remaining hydrated esp if vomiting
- Contraception
	- Do you happen to know why you are taking the pill?
	- COCP is a risk factor for clotting in people with migraines with aura
	- Options for contraception:
		- Progesterone-only pill - suppresses ovulation, keeping your ovaries from releasing an egg and thickens cervix mucous
		- Intrauterine device
		- Depot - Depo Provera is **a hormone used for contraception**. It is given by injection and its effects will last for three months at a time. It is similar to progesterone
		- Bar (implant)
		- Surgical options (tubal ligation, hysterectomy) - unlikely at age
- Options for skincare:
	- Wash
	- Benzoyl peroxide
	- Topical retinoids
- Options for heavy menstrual bleeding:
	- TXA - Tranexamic acid is used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in women - antifibrinolytic agent. It works by blocking the breakdown of blood clots, which prevents bleeding.
	- NSAID (mefenamic acid)
	- Hormonal IUD
- Options for endo/pain:
	- NSAIDs
	- Laparoscopy
- Barrier contraception for STIs! 

  
5. Preventative opportunities
- Immunisations - flu and COVID?
- CST?
- Chlamydia urine test - RACGP life-cycle charts up to 29 years old opportunistically → have you had one before?
- BP every two years

6. Other chronic problems
- Mental health?
- Smoking - nil?
- Alcohol - within guidelines, good
- Nutrition → helps prevent migraines
- Physical activity → helps prevent migraines

7. Summarise plan, any questions?

8. Take-away info
- migraine.org.au - Migraine Australia
- Murtaugh’s handout - migraine
  
9. Safety net
- Return if medications not helping, any side-effects, headaches more than twice per month
- New neurological symptoms (vision changes, weakness) or migraine >72 hours (status migrainosus), any other concerns? → ED
- And if your contraception changes, if you have any concerns about changes to bleeding, discharge, fevers → GP or ED
- Mental health concerns → 000, lifeline, BeyondBlue


10. Follow-up
- Come back in about 6-8/52 to see if improved migraines and contraception
