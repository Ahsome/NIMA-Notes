**Management Plan:**
- Address the causes of ED - small artery blockage, stress, weight, diabetes
- First-line management - weight-loss, stress relief, better diet and exercise
	- Urgency to reduce weight with a supervised diet and regular aerobic exercise such as walking at a moderate pace for 45 minutes, 3 – 4 times per week
	- Relaxation techniques such as mindfulness and for him to re-prioritise time for work and play
- Management of blood glucose and diabetes 
- Other investigations - CT coronary artery calcium score (to assess for blockage)
- Last stage treatment could involve low intensity shockwave therapy can stimulate the body to produce new healthy arteries


Approximately 50% of men Johnny’s age have erectile dysfunction. Causes of ED include blockage of the small arteries to the penis, nerve damage, low testosterone, medications, dysfunction of the mechanism that normally seals blood within the penis and performance anxiety. Any stress such as fear of failure results in the release of adrenaline which rapidly causes deflation.
