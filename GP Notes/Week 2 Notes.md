# Breast conditions
- Breast lumps - round, firm, smooth, mobile, may be tender 
	- Fibroadenoma 20-30 years
	- Simple cyst
	- Abscess
	- Fat necrosis
	- Breast cancer
- Triple assessment 
	- To increase diagnostic accuracy, maximise pre-operative diagnosis, minimise excision biopsy for diagnosis 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230705035446.png]]
	- Core biopsy with USS guidance is recommended 
	- Nipple inversion and retraction are important signs 
	- Sensitivity - 99.6%, Specificity - 62%
	- Women <35 - USS, then mammography 
- Breast cancer
	- Symptoms:
		- Lump esp in axillary tail
		- Nipple discharge - spontaneous, unilateral, clear or blood-stained
		- Nipple inversion, deviation, "rash"
		- Dimpling of skin or peau d'orange
		- Pain alone
		- Swollen axillary lymph nodes
	- Screening for women 50-74yrs
		- Women <40 are not routinely screened - young breasts are denser, harder to visualise 
		- ![[Pasted image 20230705040425.png]]
		- 2 view mammograms (craniocaudal and oblique), 2 readers, 2 yearly for most women
		- If breast cancer in first degree relative - yearly screening
		- Personal Hx of breast cancer, LCIS, ADH, ALH - annual lifelong screening 
	- History
		- ![[Pasted image 20230705040713.png]]
	- Mastalgia (breast pain)
		- Most is cyclical, occurs in the second-half of menstrual cycle and resolves with menses
		- Symmetrical, dull/achey
		- If "tight", "burning", or "sore" and on meds: digoxin, frusemide, spironolactone, SSRIs (sertraline)
		- Low fat diet, caffeine reduction, adjust OCP, weight loss to reduce prolactin


# Vaginal discharge and STIs
- History advice
	- Use language that you are comfortable with
	- Non-judgemental attitude
	- Consider what emotions the patient may be feeling
	- Affirm confidentiality
	- Preface your line of questioning
	- Appropriate environment with adequate privacy
	- Communication with trans - preferred pronouns, etc.
- ![[Pasted image 20230705041518.png]]
- Pre-puberty discharge is not usual - consider vulvo-vaginitis, foreign body (toilet paper), sexual trauma or abuse 
- Reproductive years
	- ![[Pasted image 20230705041805.png]]
- Indications for testing vaginal discharge
	- High risk of STI
	- Failed previous treatment
	- Post ToP, post-partum and pregnant women
	- Recent IUD insertion
	- Upper genital tract infection
	- "Recurrent diagnosis"
	- If the woman requests
- Non-infective causes of pathological discharge
	- Cervical lesions - ectropion/polyps
	- FB - retained tampon or condom
	- Atrophic vaginitis
	- Dermatitis
	- Malignancy
	- Ectopic pregnancy
	- Anal or fecal fistula
- Infections (non-STI)
	- Group B strep
	- Bacterial vaginosis - especially in WLW - fishy odour - metronidazole or clindamycin
		- White non-adherent discharge
	- Candida albicans - vaginal azole creams
- STIs - most accurate testing is after 7 days = get a endocervix swab and PCR
	- Trichomonas vaginais - protozoa
		- Strwberry cervix
		- Yellow/green, frothy, malodorous
		- Metronidazole 2g
		- Not notifiable in QLD
		- ![[Pasted image 20230705044407.png]]
	- Chlamydia trachomatis
		- Asymptomatic 75%
		- Intermenstrual bleeding
		- Post-coital bleeding
		- Dysuria (urethral infection)
		- Mucopurulent discharge (cervicitis)
		- PID - abdo pain, deep dyspareunia, systemic symptoms
		- <29 years of age most common age group
		- ![[Pasted image 20230705044545.png]]
		- Males - Clear/milky discharge, anorectal pain, testicular pain
		- Complications:
			- PID
			- Infertility
			- Epididymo-orchitis
			- Reactive arthritis 
			- Tx: doxy 100mg bd, azithromycin 1g
			- Contact tracing - 6 months prior, partner notification and 3 month test for re-infection
			- ![[Pasted image 20230705053720.png]]
	- Neisseira gonorrhoea
		- Gram -ve intracelluar diplococcus - infects columnar and transitional epithelium
		- Primary infection - urethra, endocervix, rectum, pharynx, conjunctivitis 
		- MSM, remote ATSI
		- 80% asymptomatic in females, but men can have purulent discharge
		- Uncomplicated - ceftriaxone 500mg IM, azithromycin PO stat
		- Contact tracing - previous 2 months
		- Notifiable disease
	- HSV 2
	- Mycoplasma genitalium
	- A STI testing should include HIV and syphyllis testing, chlamydia, gonorrhoea
	- ![[Pasted image 20230705054048.png]]



# Contraception
- ![[Pasted image 20230705054707.png]]
- IUD - prevent fertilisation and implantation, easily reversible 
	- Risks: infection, perforation, expulsion, vasovagal symptoms, heavier periods/pain, irregular periods 
- Etonogestrel implant - progestrone only subdermal implant prevents ovulation
	- Efficacy impacted by hepatic enzyme modulators
	- Less than normal menstruation
	- Safe to use in women with risk of VTE (venous thromboembolism)
- Depot progesterone injections - stops ovuation, thickens mucous and thins endometrium
	- PBS listed, discrete
	- 7 days until effective --> amenorrhoea increases over time
	- Delayed return to fertility, weight gain, bone density effects
	- Not first line for women <18 or >45 (cardiogenic, osteoporosis)
- Progesterone only pill
	- Strict adherence required - 3 hours late = "missed pill"
- Combined hormonal contraception
	- Risk - VTE (increases 2-3 fold), history of migraine with aura
	- Estradiol and progesterone 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230705060052.png]]
	- Takes 7 days of pills to become effective 
	- PBS
	- 24 late = "missed pill"
	- Vaginal ring - one ring per cycle (similar levels of EE and LNG)
- Condoms, diaphragm
	- Effective for contraception and STI protection
- Sterilisation
	- Vasectomy (reversible) - check for azoospermia 12wks after surgery
	- Tubal sterilisation - increases risk of ectopic pregnancy
- Emergency contraception
	- ![[Pasted image 20230705060544.png]]

Vaginal bleeding - infection or STI

**History**

4. Regularity
5. Fibroids - increased urinary frequency, back pain, constipation
6. PCOS - hirsutism
7. Galactorrhea - hyperprolactinemia
8. Last CST, mammogram, pelvic bimanual exam
	1. Check vulva for ulceration / discharge / scaling
	2. Cough impulse for prolapse 
	3. Cervix 
	4. Anteverted uterus is easier to palpate 
	5. Check adnexal structures
	6. When removing fingers at the end, check the glove for discharge or bleeding

**INVX**
1. FBC, pregnancy test, coagulation screen, prolactin, LH/FSH (esp for PCOS)
2. USS for polps
