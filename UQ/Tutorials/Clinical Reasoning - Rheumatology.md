# Scenarios:
## Scenario 1:
> You are an Intern in ED. You are seeing Brian, a 65-year old man. He complains of severe pain and swelling in his right knee. He is struggling to walk and this a particularly a problem because he has stairs at home

### Questions to ask:
1. History of PC:
	1. Nature of pain?
	2. Which joints affected?
	3. Does the pain migrate?
	4. Patient has fever?
2. PMHx:
	4. History of gout
3. Social history:
	1. IV drug use
	2. Occupation, with mechanical injury
	3. Alcohol, given gout + osteomyelitis
	4. Hobbies, such as exercise or working
	5. Sexual: Neisseria, ghonorrhea, chlamydia (reactive)
4. O/E:
	1. Range of motion
	2. Erythema and pain of joint
	3. Effusion of knee
	4. Rash or wound
	5. Muscle wasting: Differentiates acute vs chronic
	6. OBS: Fever/tachy
	7. Signs of endocarditis
	8. Skin changes
	9. Eyes (uveitis)
	10. Other joins involved

### Patients info:
1. PMHx:
	1. T2DM
	2. Peripheral neuropathy
	3. Diabetic nepropathy
	4. HTN
	5. Hyperlipidemia
2. DH:
	1. Metformin
	2. Insulin
	3. Irbesartan
	4. Atorvastatin
3. FH:
	1. Nill
4. SH:
	1. Non-smoker, drinks 3 beers/day, independent

### Differentials:
1. Rheumatoid arthritis
	1. Not excluded, less likely
2. Septic arthritis
	1. Cannot miss, diabetic
3. Osteoarthritis
	1. Far less liekly given acuity
4. Gout
	1. Renal imparment adds weight
5. Reactive arthritis
6. Cancer
	1. Remain on radar but less common/likely

#### How to identify differentials:
1. FBC for signs of infection
2. Joint aspiration
3. Chem20
	1. Check for renal function and urate level
4. CRP
5. UEC
	1. Cr especially important and eFGR
6. Arthrocentesis
7. X-ray
	1. Erosisons, chondrocalcinosis
8. U/S
	1. Unsure if subcutaneous oedema or joint effusion

## Scenario 2:
>???

### Questions to ask:
1. History of PC:
2. PMHx:
3. Social history:
4. O/E:
	1. Right knee synovitis with effusion

### Patients info:
1. PMHx:
2. DH:
3. FH:
4. SH:
5. O/E:
	1. Joint aspirations

### Differentials:
1. Septic arthritis
	1. Make sure to check that WCC >= 50,000 and Polymorphs > 75%, in this case patient has 90%

#### How to identify differentials:
1. FBC for signs of infection
2. Joint aspiration
3. Chem20
	1. Check for renal function and urate level
4. CRP
5. UEC
	1. Cr especially important and eFGR
6. Arthrocentesis
7. X-ray
	1. Erosisons, chondrocalcinosis
8. U/S
	1. Unsure if subcutaneous oedema or joint effusion

# Information:

## Drugs:
### Allopurinol:
#### Issues:
1. Can cause rash, result into stephen johnson
2. More issues with the Han chinese
---
## Diagnosis:

### Gout:
#### Signs:
1. Severe pain, redness, warmth, swelling and disability
2. At least 80% of initial flares involve a single joint, normally podagra
3. Polyarticular flares likely in longstanding disease
4. Sustained chronic hyperuricemia may develop tissue deposits of solid urate
5. Most common antiinflammatory arthritis for men

#### Risk factors:
1. Trauma
2. Surgery
3. Starvation
4. Dehhydration
5. Drugs affecting (thiazide)

#### Diagnosis:
Diagnosis involves:
- Bifringe crystals, positive or negative
- < 50,000 WCC
- < 75% polymorphs

#### Management:
##### Acute management:
1. Pain management
2. Steroid treatment (if monoarticular), but watch for CKD and other issues that are exacerbated from steroids
3. **Tutor prefers** colchicine

##### Long term:
1. Allupurinal, but ***BUT DO NOT START WITH IT**,* as it will precipetate another attack
	1. Start with a few weeks after the first flare, normally colchicine

##### Targets:
You look for when serum uric acid level <0.36mmok/L in gout and <0.3 mmol/L in tophaceous gout.

## Questions:

### Question 1:
*Which of the following is not an indication of starting urate lowering therapy ([[allopurinal]])?*
1. 2 to 3 glout flare ups per year
2. Glout flare alogn with CKD
3. Gout along with uric acid nephrolithiasis
4. Tophaceous gout

### Question 2:
*Why do we start allopurinol at a low dose and up titrate?*
B) You want to, otherwise you can kick in a flair

### Question 3:
*Why is it important to exclude septic arhtritis in a patient with single joint synovitis symptoms?*
B) Septic arhtritis causes joint destruction in a short time and needs early diagnosis and treatment
