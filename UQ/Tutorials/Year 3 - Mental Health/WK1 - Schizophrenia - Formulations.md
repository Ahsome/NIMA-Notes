		- Monitor for side effects
	- Long term
		- Initiate a case manager if possible
		- Psych education for delusional disorder
		- If need depo, keep her on TA with D/C
		- Metabolic monitoring is important
		- Regular lipid profile, ECG
		- Aim smoking cessation, maintain levels of lipid profile
- Delusional vs Schizophrenia
	- Delusional disorders: Main features are delusions, no negative symptoms, and normally not functionally impaired. Delusions are also not bizarre (e.g. not about testicles with chips).
- Things to improve with formulation
	- Always try get collateral
	- Make sure you know the patients behaviour over the past few weeks of precipitation
	- Know history of violence, charges, going to jail
	- Any risk to self, suicidal ideation, self harmed
	- Potential urine drug screen
