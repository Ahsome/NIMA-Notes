# Overall Notes:
- Make sure you learn all of the mental health act requirements
- If person has bipolar disorder with depressant properties, do not only treat with antidepressant, make sure you have mood stabiliser. Otherwise, if you do not, they can have an induced manic episode, which can ruin their reputation/finances

	- ![[Pasted image 20230929080137.png]]
- Management
	- Immediate:
		- within 24 hours
		- What is the dispositon? Can they go home or stay in hospital
		- Do you need to use the mental health care act
			- Risk to themselves or others
			- No capacity
			- No restrictive treatment
			- Has to have a mental illness
			- One clinician puts under RA, then authorised doctor puts under treatment authority (TA).
				- TA needs to be endorsed by psychiatrist within certain time, can be initiated by intern with mental health act (I heard 3 days,  not sure)
		- Can do blood panel for psychosis
			- FBC, CHEM20, thyroid, lipid profile (antipsychotics increase lipid profile), fasting glucose+ HbA1c (due to psychotic meds risk), prolactin (due to psychotic meds risk)
		- ECG baseline (psychotropic meds can increase QT interval)
		- CK level
		- Hepatitise serology (IVDU)
		- STI (Syphillus)
		- Potential fancy antibody test
		- LP
		- MRI, controversial, used in atypical test
		- medications
			- Good ones include Risperidone
			- Obtain entire treatment history from patient, which is lbetter
	- Medium
		- During their hospital admission
		- Seriel reviews, MSSE
		- Monitoring behaviour (15:60) by nurses
		- Check functioning
		- Check socialising
		- Check sleeping
		- Gain collateral
		- Get allied health
			- Social
				- Housing
				- Centrelink
			- OT
				- Check if patient can handle follow
			- Psychologist
				- Cognitive assessment (main role)
				- Therapy (not as much with psychotic & delusional disorder)
		- Monitor for side effects
	- Long term
		- Initiate a case manager if possible
		- Psych education for delusional disorder
		- If need depo, keep her on TA with D/C
		- Metabolic monitoring is important
		- Regular lipid profile, ECG
		- Aim smoking cessation, maintain levels of lipid profile
- Delusional vs Schizophrenia
	- Delusional disorders: Main features are delusions, no negative symptoms, and normally not functionally impaired. Delusions are also not bizarre (e.g. not about testicles with chips).
- Things to improve with formulation
	- Always try get collateral
	- Make sure you know the patients behaviour over the past few weeks of precipitation
	- Know history of violence, charges, going to jail
	- Any risk to self, suicidal ideation, self harmed
	- Potential urine drug screen
	- What have they tried before, has it been effective
	- Depo if cannot maintain treatment
