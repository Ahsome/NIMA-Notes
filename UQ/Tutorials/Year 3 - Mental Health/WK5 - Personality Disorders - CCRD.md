**Presentation:**

You are working as the Orthopedic intern and have been asked to assess Sharnee, a 52-year-old woman who was brought to hospital by ambulance. Sharnee’s friend Jazmin called the ambulance after she found Sharnee collapsed at home with self-inflicted lacerations of both wrists. Sharnee is initially reluctant to discuss the reason for this episode of self-harm, but later says that she cut herself after she found out on Facebook that a former boyfriend is now in a new relationship.  

Nursing staff recognize Sharnee as “a regular”. Her medical file reveals multiple presentations with self-harm, ranging from overdoses to wrist lacerations. She has on one occasion required admission to ICU following an overdose. Sharnee has sustained tendon damage and the lacerations now need to be repaired in theatre. She is on the list for theatre but it is likely this will not happen today. She is angry with staff and they have called you down to ED to see her because she is demanding to leave the hospital.

**Mental status examination:**

Thin woman, with multiple tattoos and body piercings. Multiple scars across both forearms. Poor eye contact, with irritable manner. Looks depressed. Refuses to cooperate with history-taking, shouting: “_Just leave me alone. You doctors are just full of it. I’ll just cut deeper next time.”_

**1**      Why do people harm themselves? What might be the motivating factors and what underlying conditions might drive people to harm themselves?

**2**      What feelings are likely to be aroused in health professionals involved in the care of patients like Sharnee? How might health professionals respond to Sharnee? How will this affect Sharnee’s behaviour?

a.     What is transference and countertransference?
- Transference is the redirection of feelings about a specific person onto someone else (in therapy, this refers to a client's projection of their feelings about someone else onto their therapist). 
- Countertransference is the redirection of a therapist's feelings toward the client.

**3**      How would you manage Sharnee’s demands to leave the hospital? How would you manage this if you are not sure?

**4**      What are the considerations for using the mental health act/involuntary care in this situation?

**5**      How would you assess Sharnee’s risk if she refuses to engage in history taking?

The nursing staff find out that Sharnee’s tendon repair is the next case on the theatre list. Sharnee wants to stay and agrees to talk to you further tomorrow. You look through Sharnee’s file and note a recent social work assessment.

Sharnee has mental health diagnoses documented as borderline personality disorder, depression and anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, amphetamine abuse and schizoaffective disorder. The social work assessment gives details about Sharnee’s prejudicial childhood and subsequent history: Sharnee is the youngest of 7 children. Her father abused alcohol and was violent, frequently assaulting Sharnee’s mother and the children. He died from injuries sustained in a fight when Sharnee was 6 years of age. Her mother had multiple partners before re-marrying when Sharnee was 12 years of age. Her step-father sexually abused Sharnee until she ran away from home at 14 years of age.

Sharnee was involved in multiple relationships in her adolescence and early twenties, several of which involved violence. She has three children who are now all adults. The older two children were raised in foster care as Sharnee had a significant drug problem (amphetamines) at that time. When she became pregnant with her third child, she stopped amphetamines and has not used any substances in the 22 years since. Sharnee experienced a period of relative mental health stability for around 16 years, employed as a disability support worker. When her third child finished high school and left home to move in with their partner, Sharnee’s mental health deteriorated.

Sharnee started cutting again to cope with distress. She lost her job due to frequently not attending and getting into arguments with the management. She has also had multiple relationships, all of which have been brief and tumultuous.

**6**      What are the personality traits as conceptualised in DSM-V?
- 

**7**      When is it considered a ‘Personality disorder’?
- Personality traits are fixed patterns of behaviour and are ways of interacting with ones environment e.g. kind, confident, lazy, rude
- Personality disorder are similar, but they cause distress or impaired function and he person is often unaware that they have a personality disorder, and they are difficult to treat

**8**      Can these personality traits be adaptive and beneficial?  

**9**      What are the risks and benefits of making a diagnosis of personality disorder?

**10**    What may have predisposed Sharnee to having a borderline personality disorder?

**11**    Why does Sharnee have multiple psychiatric diagnoses?

When arriving at work the next day the nursing staff ask you to see Sharnee first. She has been angry and yelling at the staff all morning. She has accused her assigned nurse of purposely taking too long to get her medication and refuses all nurses except the nurse unit manager, who she feels is the only good nurse on the ward.

The nurse unit manager has asked you to contact the CL team. Sharnee overhears this conversation and starts yelling “I won’t see any psychiatrists. They are absolutely useless. Last time they recommended I do therapy for a whole year! As if that is going to happen.”

**12**    What is splitting?

**13**    How would you manage Sharnee and the nursing staff’s concerns?

**14**    Who are the CL team? How may they help in this situation?

**15**    How might her past experiences affect Sharnee’s attitude towards psychiatric team?

**16**    What are the elements of DBT? Why may DBT be better for someone with a borderline personality disorder, than CBT?

**17**    What evidence is there regarding the benefits or risks associated with pharmacological treatments in patients with personality disorders?

![Text Box:  Personal Reflection – for you to think about and NOT necessarily for discussion in the CCRD
Personality traits or characteristics are what make us unique. Think about your own characteristics. Many students are obsessional. This can be an asset in terms of achieving objectives, but being highly obsessional can also mean that we set goals that are unrealistic, leading to disappointment and even depression. Being obsessional can mean it is hard to delegate or even let others help us, as we feel “I should be able to do this” and we don’t want others to think we are weak. If you note these elements to your personality, how can you best manage them? 
Do you see other personality traits within yourself, your friends and family? Being aware of your own personality characteristics, as well as others, can help you work better in teams.](file:////Users/nanthi/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.png)
