# Key Info
- Common anorectal condidtions are: perianal haematoma, haemorrhoids, and anal fissures
- Less common, not to be missed conditions are anal carcinoma and low rectal carcinoma
- History:
	- Change in bowel habit, red flag for carcinoma
	- Blood mixed with faeces (carcinoma), can also indicate rectal polyps
	- Bright red blood on paper/bowel is associated with haemorrhoids
	- Rectal pain: Distinguish uncomplicated haemorrhoids (painless) and fissures (painful)
	- Tenesmus is commonly associated with IBS, can also mean abnormal mass in rectum/anal canal
- See Table for likely diagnosis of anorectal pain: See [[#Diagnosis]]
- Anal canal is 5cm, roughly length of index finger so most anal pathologies can be detected via digital examination
- Rectum (~18cm) examination can utilise:
	- disposable proctoscope (anoscope), ~7cm, which covers distal rectum
	- rigid sigmoidoscope, ~25cm, for entire length of rectum. May require bowel prep
- [[#Perianal hameatoma (thrombosed external pile)]]: Small subcutaneous haematoma, caused by increased intra-thoracic pressure/lifting, treatment is local anaesthetic and incision over skin
- [[#Haemorrhoids]]: Enlargement of vascular cushion, classified into 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th degree. See [[#^a2a953|Definitions]]
- **Haemorrhoid management**:
	- 1st degree: High fibre, mild laxatives, avoid constipating drugs. Rarely sclerosant injection and ligation if not responding
	- 2nd degree: Conservative management + sclerosant, or ligation
	- 3rd degree: Minor cases may use rubber band ligation, otherwise surgical haemorrhoidectomy
	- 4th degree: Immediate hospital admission, analgesia, perineal ice packs, urgent haemorrhoidectomy
- **Anal fissure**: First line is conservative treatment (high fibre diet, faecal softeners, local anaesthethic gel, topical GTN 3x day). Lateral sphincterotomy if not responsive to treatment
- Anal cancer similar presentation to haemorrhoids, consider small biopsy
- Distal rectal carcinoma may present with haemorrhoid initially
- All patients with haemorrhoids, tenesmus and change in bowel habits should be referred to specialist for colonoscopy

# Diagnosis:
Summary of possible diagnosis and associated symptoms:

## Perianal hameatoma (thrombosed external pile)
Perianal haematoma are small subcutaneous haematoma (not true haemorrhoid), with dark blue/almost black appearance:
- Caused by burst perianal vein, normally post heavy lifting or increased abdominal pressure (cough, sneezing)
- Immediate relief via local anaesthetic in skin over lump, followed by small incision in the overlying skin
- Recent blood clot is usually under pressure under thin skin, popping out of wound brings relief
- ![[Pasted image 20231101213930.png]]

## Haemorrhoids
Enlargement of normally occuring vascular tissue in the submucosal layer of the proximal part of the colon. Progressive enlargement causes descent during straining and causes bleeding

Broken into four forms: ^a2a953
1. First degree haemorrhoids: Bleed during defecation, but no prolapse
2. Second degree haemorrhoids: Bleed during defecation, prolapse, not reduce spontaenously after defecation
3. Third degree haemorrhoids: Bleed during defecation, prolapse, painful if large and need to be manually reduced
4. Fourth degree haemorrhoids: Thrombosed internal piles, permanent and irreducable. Associated with mucous discarge

### **Management:**
- Depends on degree of prolapse and extent of symptom.
- All patients require conservative management, those with second degree or more may require additional measures
- Conservative management include: Increase fibre intake, mild laxatives, avoiding constipating drugs (e.e. codeine)

![[Pasted image 20231101214712.png]]
**Sclerosant injection**
- Sclerosant injected at neck of haemorrhoid, proximal part of anal canal where mucosa is relatively insensitive
- Causing blanching of mucosa
- May cause sloughing, prostatic hematoma and abscesses

**Rubber band ligation**
- Suitable for second degree haemorrhoids, and some third degree
- Rubber band is applied via applicator through proctoscope

**Surgical haemorrhoidectomy:**
- Required for some third degree, and all fourth degree haemorrhoids
- Recent interest in stapled haemorrhoidectomy and Doppler guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation

**Further management**
- Fourth degree management usually require urgent hospital admission, analgeisa, perianal ice packs, and urgent haemorrhoidectomy due to distressing symptoms of pain and mucous discharge with irreducible prolapsed haemorrhoids

## Anal Fissure:
Subacte condition, causing marked spasm of anal sphincter (preventing use of digital examination or anoscopy)
- Almost always midline posteriorly
- Pain aggravated by bowel action, preventing patient to go to toilet

### Treatment:
Initial treatmnet:
- High fibre diet
- Faecal softeners
- Topical application of local anaesthetic gel
- Local application of GTN, 3x daily by patient, may cause transient headache

Further treatment:
- Botulinim toxic can be injected, creating chemical sphincterotomy for 3 months
- Specialist referral for lateral subcutaneous sphinterotomy, involves distal half of external sphicnter to be divided
- Comlications involve incontinence, loss of flatus, mucus, and fistula

## Anal carcinoma and distal rectal carcinoma
**Anal Carcinoma:**
Anal carcinoma have similar presentation to haemorrhoid, confirmed suspician via digital examination:
- Persisent lump at anal verge
- Feeling of lump in anal region
- Tenesmus
- Occasional bleeding and discharge
Small biopsy should be done for histopathology

**Rectal carcinoma:**
Distal rectal carcinoma may present with haemorrhoid initially
