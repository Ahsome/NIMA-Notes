# Key Info
- This is a summarised, one-PDF version of all the stems to conduct in patient with anaphylaxis

# Steps for Anaphylaxis Emergency Management:

Remember key clinical features:
- Any acute onset of hypotension or bronchospasm or upper airway obstruction where anaphylaxis is considered possible, even if typical skin features are not present, ***OR*
- Any acute onset illness with typical skin features (urticarial rash or erythema/flushing, and/or angioedema) **PLUS** Involvement of respiratory, cardiovascular, or persistent severe gastrointestinal symptoms

1. Step 1: Immediate action
	1. Call assistance
	2. Lay patient flat, **DO NOT ALLOW TO STAND OR WALK**
	3. If unconscious, recovery position, left lateral if pregnant
	4. Hold young children flat, not upright
	5. ![[Pasted image 20231101014936.png]]
2. Give IM Adrenaline into mid-lateral thigh without delay

	2. ![[Pasted image 20231101015017.png]]
3. Call ambulance to transport patient to hospital
	1. Keep patient flat, transfer via stretcher, do NOT allow to walk even if appear to be recovered
4. Supportive management:
	1. Monitor pulse, BP, RR, O2
	2. Give O2 and airwya if needed
	3. Obtain IV access in adults and hypotensive children
	4. If hypotensive, give IV saline 20mL/kg rapidly and reconsider IV access
5. Additional measures
	1. Adrenaline infusion if inadequare repsonse or deterioration
		1. Mix 1mL of 1:1000 adrenaline in 1000mL of normal saline
		2. Infuse 5mL/kg/hour (0.1mc/kg/min)
		3. Titrate rate according to response
		4. Monitor
	2. If ineffective/unavailable, consider:
		1. For upper airway obstruction
			1. Nebulaised adrenaline (5ml i.e. 5 ampiles o 1:1000)
			2. Intubation if skilles and equipment are available
		2. For persistent hypotension/shock
			1. Give normal saline (max 50mL/kg in first 30 min)
			2. in patient with cardiogenic shock (esp. if with beta blockers), give IV glucagon 
				1. bolus 1-2mg in adults
				2. 20-30microgram/kg, up to 1mg
				3. In adults, selective basoconstrictors metaraminol (2-10mg) or agripressin/vasopressin (10-40 units). Only after advice from specialist
			3. For persistent wheezr
				1. Bronchodilators: 8-12 puffs of 100mcg using a spacer, or 5mg salbutamol by nebuliser
				2. Oral pred 1mg/kg ( Max 50mg ) or IV hydrocortison 5mg/kg (Max 200mg)
6. Observation for at least 4 hours after last dose. Observe longer/overnight if patient:
	1. had a severe reaction (hypotension or hypoxia)
	2. required repeated doses of adrenaline
	3. has a history of asthma or protracted anaphylaxis,
	4. has other concomitant illness
	5. lives alone or is remote from medical care
	6. has known systemic mastocytosis.
7. Follow up:
	1. Corticosteroids The role of corticosteroids is unknown. It is reasonable to prescribe a 2-day course of oral steroid (e.g. prednisolone 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg daily) to reduce the risk of symptom recurrence after a severe reaction or a reaction with marked or persistent wheeze. Corticosteroids should only be administered after adrenaline and resuscitation.
	2. Adrenaline (epinephrine) autoinjector
		1. Prescribe an autoinjector, pending specialist review. Train the patient in autoinjector use and give them an ASCIA Action Plan for Anaphylaxis -
	3. Allergy specialist
		1. Refer patients with anaphylaxis for review

**NOTES:**
Antihistamines Antihistamines have no role in treating respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms of anaphylaxis. Oral non-sedating antihistamines treat itch and urticaria. Injectable promethazine should NOT be used in anaphylactic shock as it can worsen hypotension.
