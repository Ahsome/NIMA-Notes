# Key Info:
1. It is **NOT** a diagnosis of exclusion; positive diagnosis should be given if criteria has been met and no red flags. See [[#Diagnosis]] for diagnosis and [[#^12131a|Red Flags]]
2. Treatment involves [[#Consultation]], [[#Diet]], [[#General lifestyle]], [[#Medicine]], [[#Psychological therapies]], [[#Physical and behavioural therapies]]
3. If patients have idenfitied anxiety is common aggravator for symptoms, recommend further psychological therapy
4. Patients should avoid being prescribe dopiods, even in severe disease, given the risk for [[Narcotic Bowel Syndrome]]. Patients with severe disease should be handleded by gastroenterologist working with MDP team, including a psychologist
# Background
IBS is a functional gastorintestinal disorder, with no biochemical or structural abnormalities. However, it affects 9% of Australians

It has three main subtypes, given by predominant stool form (Rome criteria):
1. Diarrhoea predomiant (IBS-D)
2. Constipation predominant (IBS-C)
3. Mixed Subtype (IBS-M)

Due to broad definition, it is liekly a combination of multiple mechanisms, such as:
- Intolerance to particular foods
- Hypersensitivitiy to pain
- Psychomotinar manifestations of anxiety/stress
- Low-grade inflammation
- Altered microbiota
- Genetic factors
- Altered 5-HT metabolism

A positive clinical diagnosis should be made if the characteristic symptoms are present and red flags are absent. Red flags should prompt specialist referral.

Consultations should be provided in an empathetic manner, addressing the concerns of the patient while providing reassurance.

Manipulating diet, with the assistance of a dietitian, is an appropriate initial treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. A low-FODMAP diet is an effective therapy.

Low-dose antidepressants improve symptoms but can be accompanied by adverse effects. Antispasmodic drugs have a limited role.

Psychological therapies and gut-focused hypnotherapy are effective if patients are willing to try them
# Diagnosis:
Irritable bowel syndrome is ***NOT*** a diagnosis of exclusion, and should be given based on presence of characteristic symptoms **AND** absence of red flags:

Initial testing should be minimally invasive. Can include:
- FBC
- Urea and Electrolytes
- CRP
- LFT
- Coeliac serology
	- Due to significantly increased risk of coeliac disease among patient with symptoms that fit Rome criteria
	- Genetic testing for coeliac disease is not recommended, unliekly to discriminate between IBS and Coeliac disease

Red flags that require further testing: ^12131a
- Age over 50 years, no previous colon cancer screening and presence of symptoms
- Recent change in bowel habit in people over 50 years of age
- Evidence of overt gastrointestinal bleeding (i.e. melaena or haematochezia)
- Nocturnal pain or passage of stools
- Unintentional weight loss
- Family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease
- Palpable abdominal mass or lymphadenopathy
- Evidence of iron deficiency anaemia on blood testing
- Positive test for faecal occult blood

# Treatment:
Treatment should address patient's concerns, and minimising symptoms

## Consultation:
- Consultation can be therapeutic, although minority of patients consult their GP
- Reassuring explanation should be given empathetic manner. Sham acupuntruee was shown to provide more relief when combined with 'warm empathetic' consultation

## Diet
Patients report GI symptoms due to specific food, so should be manipulated, although avoid overly restrictive patterns and should be supervised by dietitian

### General
UK's National Institue of Health and Care (NICE) recommends eating smaller frequent meals, avoid trigger foods, avoid excess alcohol and caffeine. This has been found to be as effective as low-FODMAP diet for IBS-D

### Fibre
Insoluble fibre can worsen abdominal pain/bloating, but soluble fibres (physilium) improve symptoms, especially for IBS-C

### FODMAP
Low-FODMAP diet reduce food containing FODMAP, which are poorly absorbed by small intestine and leads to an osmotic effect which leans to excess gas production and causing pain/diarrhoea

Low FODMAP diet have been shown to significantly reduce symptoms compared to regular Australian diet.
- Dietitian-supervised low-FODMAP diet involves exclusion phase where patients reduce FODMAP-containing foods over six weeks
- Not recommended to be exclusive low-FODMAP as shown to transform intesitnal microbiota to potentially negative

## General Lifestyle
Regular exercise and sleep can also be useful

## Medicine:
Drugs exclusive for IBS not available in Australia, unlike USA and Europe. Most other drugs were designed for other indications:
- Mebeverine/Hyoscine: Antipasmodic drugs have moderate effects and have a limited role. Although hyoscine have greater evidence for symptom relief, it is associated with significant adverse effects including constipation and dry mouth
- Pepperment oil: Acts as antipasmodic through smooth muscle Calcium channel antagonism, found to help compared to placebo
- Antidepressants: Can signficiantly reduce symptoms of IBS, purported to work by manipulating visceral hypersensitivity and abnormal central painsensation,  specifically Tricyclic and SSRI. Tricyclics used for IBS-D since it can cause constipation, SSRI in IBS-C since it can cause diarrhea. Use of SSRI is due to neuropathic-pain-modulating effect, not antidepressant effect and should take a low dose everyday for 4-6 weeks
- Rifaximin: Limited role, not subsidied by PBS
- Probiotic: Possibly could help, no dose and strain identified for benefit

## Psychological therapies
Therapies include CBT, multi-component psychological therapy and dynamic psychotherapy

For patients who believe stress/anxiety exacerbate symptoms, psychological therapies for anxiety is indicated with psychologist

**Gut-focus hypnotherapy**:
Hypnotherapy has been shown to reduce symptoms and maintain benefit over 5 years, similarly effective to low-FODMAP diet

Patients should be told hypnosis is not as theoretical, and involves CBT and relxation exercises over 10 weekly sessions

## Physical and behavioural therapies
- Pelvic floor dysfunction is often undiagnosed in patients with IBS, especially IBS-C. This can be retrained via biofeedback from a physiotherapistsm where patients are given visual or tactile awareness of involuntary bowel fucntion in order to learn voluntary control
