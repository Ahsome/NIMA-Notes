# Key Things
Overall steps include:
- assessing severity (mild/moderate, severe or life-threatening) while starting bronchodilator treatment immediately
- administering oxygen therapy if peripheral capillary oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) is less than 92% in adults or less than 95% in children
- completing observations and assessments (when appropriate, based on clinical priorities determined by baseline severity)  
    administering systemic corticosteroids within the first hour of treatment
- repeatedly reassessing response to treatment and either continuing treatment or adding on treatments, until acute asthma has resolved or patient has been transferred to an intensive care unit or admitted to hospital
- observing the patient for at least 3 hours after respiratory distress or increased work of breathing has resolved
- providing post-acute care and arranging follow-up to reduce the risk of future flare-ups.

Management is for adults and children > 6 years

# Managing Steps
**Summary:**
1. Immediately, assess severity and start bronchodilator (salbutamol)
	1. Mild/moderate: Can walk and speak whole sentences in one breath
	2. Severe: Any of unable to speak sentences, visibly breathless, increased work of breathing, O2 sat 90-94%, use of accessory muscles of neck or intercostal muscles
	3. Life-threatening: Drowsy, collapsed, exhausted, cyanotic, poor repsiratory effort, oxygen sat <90%
	4. Consider anaphylaxis and manage if suspected
2. Within minutes: Reassess severity
	1. If mild/moderate and no improvement, arrange immediate transfer. If improved and stable, exit pathway. See [[#Secondary severity assessment]]
	2. If life-threatening, always transfer
	3. Continue bronchodilator, add IV magnesium sulfate if not
	4. Consider add-on treatment, such as Ipratropium. See [[#Add-On Treatment]]
	5. Arrange immediate transfer to higher-level care if no improvement or worsening symptoms
3. Within first hour: Start systemic corticosteroids
	1. Oral prednisone, continue for **5-10 days**
	2. If oral not possible, IV hydrocortisone
4. After 1 hour: Reassess response to treatment
	1. Perform spirometry, repeat pulse oximetry, check for dyspnoea while supine
	2. If dyspnea resolved:
		1. Observe for more than 1 hour
		2. Post acute care

	3. If symptoms and signs unresolved (e.g. any dyspnoea, inability to lie flat with dyspnoaea, FEV1 < 60% predicted)
		1. Admit to hospital
		2. Continue bronchodilator + add-on treatment
	4. Persistent severe or lfe threatening acute asthma:
		1. Transfer to higher-level care OR
		2. Discuss transfer or retrieval with senior medical staff

## Secondary severity assessment
When conducting secondary severity assessment of acute asthma in adults and children > 6 years, the following should be checked:

## Add-On Treatment:
Add-on treatment if needed:
