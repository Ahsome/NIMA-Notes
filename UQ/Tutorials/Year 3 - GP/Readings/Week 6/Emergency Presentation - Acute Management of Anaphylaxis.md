# Key Info:
- Make sure to check [[#Management for Anaphylaxis]]
- Remember the dosages in [[#Adrenaline administration and dosages (children + adults)]]
- Remember additional measures if adrenaline is not effective, even after infusion. See [[#^8bf22d|Additional measures if IV adrenaline infusion is ineffective]]
- **Antihistamines** have ***NO ROLE*** in treating/preventing respiratory or cardio anaphylaxis. Do not sue oral sedating antihistamines as drowsiness/lethargy may mimic signs of anaphylaxis.
- Certain patients should be considered for **overnight observation** due to potential relapse or biphasic reactions. At-risk patients are at [[#^f2c738|At-risk biphasic patients]]
- Post treatment, patients should be provided training and dispensing of **Adrenaline injector**, given a **Clinical immunology/allergy specialist referral**, provide **ASCIA anaphylaxis resources** including an ASCIA Action Plan, and recommend documentation of anaphylaxis episodes
# Notes
## Background
Document developed by ASCIA (Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy)

Anaphylaxis defined as:
- Any acute onset illness with typical skin features (urticarial rash or erythema/flushing, and/or angioedema), plus involvement of respiratory and/or cardiovascular and/or persistent severe gastrointestinal symptoms; or
- Any acute onset of hypotension or bronchospasm or upper airway obstruction where anaphylaxis is considered possible, even if typical skin features are not present.

It is highly likely if one of the two following criteria located:
- Acute onset (minutes to several hours), involves skin/mucosal tissue or both (e..g hibes, pruritus), and one of the following:
	- Respiratory compromise (e..g dyspnea, wheeze, stridor)
	- Reduce blood pressure or end-organ dysfunction
	- Severe gastrointestinal symptoms, especially after exposure to non-food allergens
- Acute onset of hypotension or bronchospasm or laryngeal involvement after exposure to known or highly probable allergen, even in asbence of typical skin conditions

Signs of allergic reactions:
- Mild:
	- Swelling of lips/face, hives, tingling of mouth
	- Abdominal pain, vomitting (signs of anaphylaxis for insect sting or injected drug)
- Anaphylaxis
	- Swelling of tongue, tightnes sin throat, difficult or noisy breathing
	- Wheeze or persistent cough
	- Dizziness, collapse, pale and floppy (young children)
	- Abdominal pain

Triggers:
- Commonly include food, insect stings, drugs, latex, tick bites, exercise, cold temperatures
- Usually occurs within 1-2 hours of ingestion of food allergy. Onset may occur rapidly (<30 minutes) or delayed (several hours, e.g. amammalian meat allergy)
- Stings and injected medications occurs within 5-30 minute, but may be delayed
## Management for Anaphylaxis
### Initial steps (children + adults)
>[!Important] ALWAYS GIVE ADRENALINE FIRST, THEN ASTHMA RELIEVER
>If someone with known asthma and allergy to food, insects or medications has SUDDEN BREATHING DIFFICULTY (including wheeze, persistent cough, or hoarse voice) even if there are no skin symptoms

>[!Important] Pregnancy
>Management of anaphylaxis in pregnant women is the ***same*** as non-pregnant women, place patient in left lateral position

Immediate actions:
1. Remove allergen, stay with person, call for assitance and locate adrenaline
2. **LAY PERSON FLAT**, do ***NOT*** allow them to stand or walk
	1. If unconscious/pregnant, place in recovery position, on left side if pregnant
	2. If breathing is difficult, allow them to sit with legs outstrtched
	3. Hold young children flat, not upright
	4. ![[Pasted image 20231101005549.png]]
	5. For more information, see [[#Positioning]]
3. **GIVE ADRENALINE INJECTOR**, IM injection into outer mid-thigh without delay using adrenaline injector or adrenaline ampoule/syringe
4. **Give oxygen** if available
5. Phone ambulance (000/111) to transport patient
6. Phone family/emergency contact
7. Further adrenaline may be given if no response after 5 minutes
8. Transfer person to hospital for at least 4 hours of obs
9. Commence CPR anytime if person is unresponsive

### Adrenaline administration and dosages (children + adults)
>[!Important] Adrenaline is the first line treatment for anaphylaxis
>Reduce airway mucosal, induce bronchodilation, vasoconstriction, increase cardiac contraction
- Give IM Adrenaline (1:1000) into outer mid-thigh (0.1mg, up to 0.5mg dose) without delay
- Dosage charted:
- ![[Pasted image 20231101010510.png]]
- If multiple doses are required to treat anaphylaxis (2-3 doses at 5 min intervals), consider adrenaline infusion
- ![[Pasted image 20231101010825.png]]
- Infants with anaphylaxis may retain pallor despite 2-3 doses of adrenaline, and this can resolve without further doses. More than 2-3 in infants can cause hypertension, tachycardia, and often misinterpreted as an ongoing cardiovascular compromise or anaphylaxis

### Positioning with Anaphylaxis
![[Pasted image 20231101011451.png]]

### Equipment for acute management of anaphylaxis
Equipment needed for acute management of anaphylaxis:
- Adrenaline 1:1000 (consider adrenaline injector availability for initial administration by nursing staff)
- 1mL syringes; 22-25 G needles (25mm length) are recommended for IM injections for all ages* (consistent with Australian Immunisation Handbook). *Exceptions are preterm/very small infants (23-25G needle length 16mm) and very large adults (22-25G and needle length up to 38mm).
- Oxygen, airway equipment, including rebreather oxygen masks, nebuliser masks and suction
- Defibrillator
- Manual blood pressure cuff
- IV access equipment (including large bore cannulae)
- At least 3 litres of normal saline
- A hands-free phone in resuscitation room, to allow health care providers in remote locations to receive instructions by phone whilst keeping hands free for resuscitation

## Supportive management and Additional measure
**Supportive management - when skills and equipment are available**:
- Check pulse, BP, ECG, O2, conscious state
- Give high flow oxygen (6-8L) if available, and airway support if needed
	- Given to patient with respiratory distress, reduced conscious, and those require repeating doses of adrenaline
- Obtain IV access in adults and tachy/hypo children. First sign of cardiovascular compromise in children is ongoing tachy, with hypo occurring later and by then making it difficulty to get IV access
- If hypotensive, give IV saline 20ml/KG rapidly and consider additional wire bore access
	- Repeat bolus if hypotension if needed
- Assess circulation to reduce risk of overtreatment:
	- Sings incude pulmonary oedema, hypertension
	- In anaphylaxis, it is recommended that simple palpable systolic blood pressure should be measured manually. This is a reliable measure of initial severity and response to treatment
	- If patient is nauseous, shaky, vomiting, or tachycardic but has normal/elevatef SBP, this may be adrenaline toxicity than worsening anaphykaxis

**Additional measures: IV adrenaline infusion in clinical setting**
- If inadequare response after 2-3 doses, or deterioration, start IV adrenaline infusion by trained staff
- IV adrenaline should be given with a dedicated line, infusion pump and anti-reflux valves
- IV boluses of adrenaline are **NOT** recommended without specialised training

Protocol for adrenaline infusion in pre-hospital, and tertiary hospitals/emergency departments. ***LIKELY LOW YIELD:***

**Additional measures if IV adrenaline ineffective:** ^8bf22d
Overview:
![[Pasted image 20231101012622.png]]

**For persistent hypotension/shock:**
- Give normal saline (max 50mL/kg in first 30 minutes)
- Patients with cardiogenic shock, consider IV glucagon bolus:
	- 1-2mg in adults
	- 20-30micrograms/kg up to 1mg in children
- In adults, selective vasoconstrictors metaraminol (2-10mg) or vasopressin (10-40 units) only after advice from emergency medicine/critical care specialist

**Advanced Airway management**
- Oxygenation is more important than intubation



## Post-administration of Adrenaline
**Observation:**
Observe patient for at least 4 hours after last dose of adrenaline. Relapse, protracted and/or biphasic reactions can occur in patients with: ^f2c738
- Had severe or protracted anaphylaxis (e.g. required repeated adrenaline doses or IV fluid resuscitation), OR
- Have a history of severe or protracted anaphylaxis, OR
- Have concomitant illness (e.g. severe asthma, history of arrhythmia, systemic mastocytosis) OR
- Live alone or are remote from medical care, OR
- Present for medical care late in the evening.

Said patients should be considered for overnight observation.

**Adrenaline injector prescription and training**:
If risk of re-exposure, or if cause is unknown, it is important ot prescribe and if possible dispense an adrenaline injector before discharge, pending specialist review with instructions

**Referral:**
Important that ALL patients with anaphylaxi are referred to a clinical immunology/allergy specialist. They can help:
- Identify/confirm cause
- Educate avoidance/preventions trategies
- Provide ASCIA Action Plan for Anaphylaxis
- Initiate allergen immunotherapy when available (for some insect venoms)
- Refer to other professionals

**Ongoing management:**
Ongoing management in communtiy is fasciltated by regular training and use of an ASCIA Action Plan, which includes instructions consistent these guidelines

Patients should be advised to document future episodes of anaphylaxis
