# Key Info:
- PPI treatment should only be started for 4 to 8 weeks with a patient with a diagnosis of GORD
- If not responsive, indication for endoscopy.
- High-dose PPI only if not receptive to initial treatment and confirmed GORD on endoscopy, prefer standard dose twice daily over double dose strength
- Regular review should be done to reduce/stop PPI treatment if symptoms are well controlled
- Both RACGP and GESA recommend not using PPIs without attempting to reduce medication to low dose/ceasation
- Bye-Bye PPI recommends attempts to reduce/stop PPI at least once per year
- A person is likely to have GORD if:
	- two or more reflux episodes per week, or
	- if symptoms are severe to significantly impair quality of life
- Response to PPI can confirm diagnosis of GORD if patient has typical reflux symptoms AND no alarm symptoms
- Endoscopy is **NOT** routinely indicated for typical reflux, but can be conducted if patient has [[#^bf1487|Red Flags]] or if patient is not responsive to [[#^2fddaf|Standard Treatment]]
- C13- and C14- urea breath test are the usual non-invasive tests for H. pyolori, the former preferred for young women as non-radioactive
- Before breath test, no antibiotic therapy for at least 4 weeks and cease PPI for 1-2 weeks to minimise false negative
- Tripple therapy is PPI, amoxicillin and clarithromycin
- Effective lifestyle changes include:
	- Stopping smoking
	- Losing weight
	- Changing diet
	- Raising bedhead
	- Others: Such as reducing meal sizes, avoiding meals before bedtime, avoiding vigorous exercise before eating

# Background info:
- GORD accounted for 13.2% of all new problems in GP, ranked 8
- This can be diagnosed if they have two or more reflux episodes per week, or if symptoms are severe to significantly impair quality of life
- Heartburn is experienced by 15% to 20% of adults at least once a week
- PPIs are in the top 2 out of 5 of prescription volume, and account 16% of all top 30 medicines

# PPI
- PPI are effective treatment for GORD, but are sometimes used inappropriately
- Treatment should only be started for 4 to 8 weeks with patients who have been diagnosed with GORD
- Regular reviewing of patients who take PPI is important, with the aim of reducing or stopping PPI treatment if symptoms are well controlled
- RACGP recommends not using PPIs long term in patients with uncomplicated disease without regular attempts at reducing dose/ceasing
- GESA recommends not using PPI long term without attempting to reduce medication 
- Bye-Bye PPI recommends attempting to reduce/cease at least once every year

# GORD:
## Symptoms
- A person is likely to have GORD if:
	- two or more reflux episodes per week, or
	- if symptoms are severe to significantly impair quality of life
	- Response to PPI can confirm diagnosis of GORD if patient has typical reflux symptoms AND no alarm symptoms
- Typical symptoms include:
	- Heartburn
	- Regurgitation
	- Waterbrash (sudden and brisk stimulation of salivation)
- Atypical symptoms:
	- Chest pain
	- Throat or voice changes
	- Coughing
	- Asthma
	- Excessive belching
	- Dyspepsia
	- Nausea
- Gastro-oesophageal reflux is a normal event that usually occurs after eating, but it is considered GORD when it becomes excessive
- Symptoms often come from induced dietary triggers:
	- High fat meals, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, citrus fruit
	- Tomato products, spicy foods
	- Carbonated beverages
	- Smoking
- Medication can also cause reflux:
	- Aspirin and NSAIDs
	- Benzodiazepines
	- Bisphosphonates
	- Calcium channel blockers
	- Medicines with anticholinergic effects, such as Tricyclic antidepressants
	- Nitrates

## Management and Causes of GORD:
- Endoscopy is **NOT** routinely recommended for patients with typical reflux symptoms, but can be done if following red flags present: ^bf1487
	- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
	- Painful swallowing (odynophagia)
	- Unexpected weight loss
	- Persistent vomiting
	- Blood in vomit (haematemesis) or dark black, tarry, stick faeces melaena
	- Signs or symptoms of anaemia
	- New onset persistent symptoms in those > 55yo

Diet and lifestyle modifications are all that is needed for mild intermittent reflux symptoms. Effective lifestyle changes:
1. Cease smoking
2. Losing weight, even moderate loss for obese patient. Likely a dose-response relationship between increasing BMI and frequency of reflux
3. Diet: Guideliens recommend avoiding individual triggers, although experimental evidence varies
4. Raising bedhead
5. Other changes: Reducing meal size, avoiding meals before bedtime, avoid vigorous exercise before meals


PPI will be needed for GORD and not responsive to diet/lifestyle changes and as-required antacids
- PPI recommended over H2 as they are more effective at standard dosages
- A PPI is recommended at standard dose, orally, once daily, 30mins-60mins before meal
- Initial course of PPI should be 4 to 8 weeks (aka one or two prescription repeats, followed by review and attempting to lower if effective
- Stepping down involves:
	- Taking standard dose less often
	- Reducing PPI to low dose
	- Only taking 'on demand'
	- Eventually stopping if well controlled
- ![[Pasted image 20231101210736.png]]
- If symptoms not controlled, discuss with patient about adherence (are they taking regularly, 30-60min before meals)
	- If adherence confirmed, endoscopy is indicated to exclude other conditions
	- High dose PPI (standard dose twice daily, or double dose, former is more effective) can be considered if GORD is found on endoscopy ^2fddaf
	- Specialist treatment if not further available

### Management involving H. Pylori
Symptoms of GORD overlap with H. Pylori infection
- Common in older, migrants, lower socioeconomic status
- Prevelance is most strongly related to living conditions in childhood

Non-invasting testing and treating for H. Pylori ('test-and-treat strategy') is cost effective with dyspepsia and no red flags:
- C13- or C14-urea breath test is usual choice
- C13- is non radioactive and preferred in women of childbearing age
- Before breath test, antibiotic therapy should not be taken for at least 4 weeks and PPI should be withheld for at least 1-2 weeks to minimise chance of false negatives

First-line therapy for H. Pylori involves tripple therapy combining amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and PPI

Guidelines recommend *H. Pylori* eradication in the following situations:
- peptic ulcer disease (past or present)
- dyspepsia
- selected users of NSAIDs (including aspirin)
- atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia
- patients requiring long-term acid suppression
- close relatives of patients with gastric cancer
- patients already treated for early gastric cancer
- low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma
- patient preference to be treated (after possible harms and benefits have been discussed)
- gastric cancer prevention in communities with high incidence of gastric cancer.
