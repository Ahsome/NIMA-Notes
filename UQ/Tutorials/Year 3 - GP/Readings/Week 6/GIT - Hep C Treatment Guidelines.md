# Key Info
1. Avoid DAA regiment treatment in pregnancy as there is no safety data
2. Patients whoa re cured of Hep C, have no cirrhosis and normal LFT results do **not** need followup
3. Monitoring should be involved with patients who have risk of re-infection
4. As Anti-HCV antibodies will remain positive in all people with prior exposure, it does **NOT** need to be re-tested with patients if they seek treatment again
# Treatment summary
The main steps for hepatitics C involve:
1. Four key questions before commencing treatment
2. Complete checklist for pre-treatment for patients with hepatitic C infection. This covers:
	1. Do they have hepatitis C before, currently
	2. Are they pregnant
	3. If they have cirrrhosis
3. On-treatment monitoring for virological response (Week 0)
4. Treatment with DAA (Direct Acting Antiviral)
5. Post-treatment monitoring for virological response (Week 12)
6. Ongoing monitoring of people after successful hepatitis C treatment outcome (SVR)

## Key questions before commencing treatment:
1. Is HCV RNA detectable?
2. Is cirrhosis present?
3.Is HBV-HCV or HIV-HCV coinfection present?
Are there potential drug-drug interactions

## Checklist for pre-treatment:
1. HCV Virology
	1. Anti-HCV: Indicate HCV exposure
	2. HCV PCR: Confirms current HCV infection
	3. HCV genotype (may be considered): May influence choice and duration of treatment regime
2. HCV treatment history (previous regimen and response):
	1. Determines treatment
3. Potential for non-adherence?
	1. Consider medical and social issues that may be barriers to medication adherence
4. Alcohol intake
	1. Cofactor for cirrhosis
5. Check for drug-drug interactions including OTC, illicit and prescribed
6. Pregnancy discussion: Due to no safety data of any ADAA regiment during pregnancy
7. Weight and body mass index: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is cofactor for cirrhosis
8. Signs of chronic liver disease
9. FBE: Baseline haemoglobin levels and low platelets (portal hypertension)
10. LFT and INRs
	1. Low albumin, raised bilirubin, raised INR suggest advanced cirrhosis
11. eGFR
	1. Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 or those with haemodialysis) should be in specialist care
12. HBV (HHBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs), HIV, HAV
	1. Specialist referral recommended for people with HBV or HIV
	2. If seronegative, vaccinate against HAV, HBV
	3. f screening for HBV/HIV cannot perform before DAA, testing should be done within 4 weeks of starting DAA
13. Cirrhosis assessment (e.g. FibroScan or APRI (Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index))
	1. Thressholds consistent with no cirrhosis: Liver stiffness <12.5kPa (FibroScan), APRI < 1

## Virological response monitoring
Two sets of monitoring:
1. Week 0: Pre-treatment blood tests, including LFTs, HCV, PCR, eGFR, FBC. See [[#Checklist for pre-treatment]]
2. Week 12: LFTs, HCV PCR (qualitative)

## Treatment:
Recommended pan-genotypic treatment protocols for people with Hep C are as follows:

|Regiment| HCV genotype | Pill Number | Duration (No Cirrhosis) | Duration (Cirrhosis) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
|First-line regiment for people who are treatment naive |
|Sofosuvir 400mg, orally, daily </br> + </br>Velpatasvir 100mg, orally, daily |1-6|1 pill daily|12 weeks|12 weeks|
|Glecaprevier 300mg, orally, daily </br>+</br> Pibrentasvir 120mg, orally, daily|1-6|Once daily (3 pills)|8 weeks|8 weeks*|
|Regiment for people who do not respond first-line therapy due to virological failure|
|Sofosbuvir 400mg, orally, daily </br>+</br> velpatsavir 100mg, orally, daily </br>+</br> voxliprevir 100mg, orally, daily|1-6|1 pill daily|12 weeks|12 weeks|
\* Treatment duration of 12 weeks may be considered for patients with compensated cirrhosis, at the discretion of the prescriber 

## Ongoing monitoring after treatment (SVR)
Ongoing monitoring for:
1. SVR, no cirrhosis, and normal LFTs results
	1. People whoa re cured to not require clinical follow-up for hepatitis
2. SVR, abnormal LFTs
	1. Patients with persistently abnormal LFT results require evaluation for other liver diseases and should be referred for gastro review
3. SVR, cirrhosis
	1. Require long-term monitoring, and should be involved with screening programs for **hepatcellular carcinoma**, **osteoporosis**, **clinically significant protal hypertension**
4. SVR, risk of reinfection
	1. Should have annual HCV RNA testing
	2. Anti-HCV antibodies will remain positive in patients with prior exposure, and does not require repeated testing
