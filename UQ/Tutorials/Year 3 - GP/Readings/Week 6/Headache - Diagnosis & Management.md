# Key Idea
- If a patient has nausea and vomitting, then it cannot be a tension headache
- If secondary headaches have been excluded, then a headache diary can be used for few weeks (4-6 weeks) to record frequency, severity, suspected triggers and medicine use
- Tension-type headaches **cannot** have nausea/vomiting or **both** photophobia and phonophobia (but can have one)
- To differentiate migraine and episodic-type headache will need **5 attacks** without aura, **2 attacks** with aura
- **Red flags** consists of both symptoms and characteristic of patients. See [[#^288bb6|Red Flags]]
- There is **no safe dose** for CT, and imaging is not recommended without a red flag

# Background Information
- 1 in 2 people will suffer a headache. 4/10 of these will have a tension-type headache, and 1/10 will have a migrane
- There are **no diagnostic tests for primary headache**
- Diagnosis involves ruling out a serious cause of secondary diagnosis through 'Red Symptoms'
- If no secondary causes, possibly use a headache diary to record frequency, severity, suspected triggers, and medicines for baseline

# Diagnostic criteria
Following are three types of primary headache, and requirements:

There are numerous red-flag symptoms:

Neuroimaging is **usually not required** unless there are red flags:
- They can cause risks, such as exposure to ionising radiation or contrast media
- Can increase risk of average lifetime risk of death due to cancer by 0.005% for 45yo if CT is done
- There is **no safe dose**

# Management:
Imaging: It is **not recommended** if there are no red flags for a patient

## Episodic tension-type headache
- Self-limiting, non-disabling type of headache, most common type of headache
- Provide information
- Reassure and symptomatic relief as needed
- Identify and eliminate trigger factors (e.g. lack of sleep)
- Can possibly treat with PT (e.g. massage, stretching) or analgesics (e.g. aspirin, NSAID, paracetamol)
- Limited evidence for regulat exercise, physio, relaxation training, CBT, and stress management

## Acute migraine:
- Less likely than [[#Episodic tension-type headache]]
- Start with analgesics (aspirin, an NSAID or paracetamol), ensure early in migrane when absorption is less impaired by reduced gastrointestinal motility. Soluble or rectal formulatons can be useful
- Add antimetic for N/V and for those who do not respond to analgesic alone. These increase motiltiy and may improve absorption.
	- Some trials show 900mg aspirin/1000mg paracetamool + metaclopramide 10mg give similar relief at 2 hours like sumatriptan 100mg
- If analgesics consistently ineffective (for 3+ migraines), or if migraine is severe, use triptan or ergot alkaloid.
