# Key Idea
- If a patient has nausea and vomitting, then it cannot be a tension headache
- If secondary headaches have been excluded, then a headache diary can be used for few weeks (4-6 weeks) to record frequency, severity, suspected triggers and medicine use
- Tension-type headaches **cannot** have nausea/vomiting or **both** photophobia and phonophobia (but can have one)
- To differentiate migraine and episodic-type headache will need **5 attacks** without aura, **2 attacks** with aura
- **Red flags** consists of both symptoms and characteristic of patients. See [[#^288bb6|Red Flags]]
- There is **no safe dose** for CT, and imaging is not recommended without a red flag
-  First choice for [[#Cluster headache]] are subcut sumatriptan 6mg or oxygen 100% at 10-15L/min for 10-20 minutes (risk of oxygen toxicity)
- Consider preventative drug therapy when patient has 2 or 3 severe migranes per month
- Preventative therapy for cluster headaches should be started right after initial cluster period, 240mg Verapamil/day, titrate to efficacy and consider adding high-dose corticosteroids to supress headaches until verapamil takes effect (bridging therapy). Perform baseline electrocardiography before starting verapamil

# Background Information
- 1 in 2 people will suffer a headache. 4/10 of these will have a tension-type headache, and 1/10 will have a migrane
- There are **no diagnostic tests for primary headache**
- Diagnosis involves ruling out a serious cause of secondary diagnosis through 'Red Symptoms'
- If no secondary causes, possibly use a headache diary to record frequency, severity, suspected triggers, and medicines for baseline

# Diagnostic criteria
Following are three types of primary headache, and requirements:

There are numerous red-flag symptoms:

Neuroimaging is **usually not required** unless there are red flags:
- They can cause risks, such as exposure to ionising radiation or contrast media
- Can increase risk of average lifetime risk of death due to cancer by 0.005% for 45yo if CT is done
- There is **no safe dose**

# Management:
Imaging: It is **not recommended** if there are no red flags for a patient

## Episodic tension-type headache
- Self-limiting, non-disabling type of headache, most common type of headache
- Provide information
- Reassure and symptomatic relief as needed
- Identify and eliminate trigger factors (e.g. lack of sleep)
- Can possibly treat with PT (e.g. massage, stretching) or analgesics (e.g. aspirin, NSAID, paracetamol)
- Limited evidence for regulat exercise, physio, relaxation training, CBT, and stress management

## Acute migraine:
- Less likely than [[#Episodic tension-type headache]]
- Start with analgesics (aspirin, an NSAID or paracetamol), ensure early in migrane when absorption is less impaired by reduced gastrointestinal motility. Soluble or rectal formulatons can be useful
- Add antimetic for N/V and for those who do not respond to analgesic alone. These increase motiltiy and may improve absorption.
	- Some trials show 900mg aspirin/1000mg paracetamool + metaclopramide 10mg give similar relief at 2 hours like sumatriptan 100mg
- If analgesics consistently ineffective (for 3+ migraines), or if migraine is severe, use triptan or ergot alkaloid. Change dose or replace triptan if not effective after three migraines
- Ergot alkaloid is limited by adverse effects (e.g. peripheral vasoconstriction) and availaility in Australia only in injectable form

## Cluster headache
- Rare, mainly seen in males
- Severe pain, significant cluster period and expensive to treat
- Acute treatment focused on quick symptomatic relief due to rapid onset and short time to peak intensity
- First choice are subcut sumatriptan 6mg or oxygen 100% at 10-15L/min for 10-20 minutes (risk of oxygen toxicity)
- Combine acute with preventive treatment until the latter becomes effective and/or if further headaches occur. Preventing further headaches is te focus of therapy

## Prevention
- Consider non-drug strategies for preventing migraines. These often occur due to triggers (e.g. stress)
- Physical (exercise, yoga) and psychological (CBT, relaxation, stress management) can be helpful. These may have added benefit when combined with preventive drug therapy
- Consider preventive drug therapy when patient has 2 or 3 severe migraines per month.
- Guidelines define successful preventive therapy has halving migraine frequency within 3 months. This is often unachievable and patients still require acute drug therapy
- Preventive drugs are relative non-specific, and may take 1-3 months for full effects. Withdraw after 4-6 months to assess continuing need, gradually over 2-3 weeks to avoid rebound headache
- Preventative therapy for cluster headache is aimed to suppress headaches and maintain remission over cluster period (6-12 weeks). Start prevention as soon as possible after new cluster period.
- First line prevention for [[#Cluster headache]] is verapamol, 240mg/day, tritrate according to efficacy and tolerability. Continue until ll headaches stop within 7-12 days, then withdraw by progressive dose reduction
- Guidelines suggest short course high-dose corticosteroids (e.g. predis[ol]one) to suppress headaches until verapamil takes effect (sometimes called bridging therapy)
- Perform baseline electrocardiography before startingverapamil, repeat 10 days after each dose change
