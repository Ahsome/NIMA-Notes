# Key Things
Key things with children:
- **Avoid systemic corticostreroids within first hour for children 1-5** if wheezing responds to intiial treatment
Overall steps include:
- assessing severity (mild/moderate, severe or life-threatening) while starting bronchodilator treatment immediately
- administering oxygen therapy if peripheral capillary oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) is less than 92% in adults or less than 95% in children
- completing observations and assessments (when appropriate, based on clinical priorities determined by baseline severity)  
    administering systemic corticosteroids within the first hour of treatment
- repeatedly reassessing response to treatment and either continuing treatment or adding on treatments, until acute asthma has resolved or patient has been transferred to an intensive care unit or admitted to hospital
- observing the patient for at least 3 hours after respiratory distress or increased work of breathing has resolved
- providing post-acute care and arranging follow-up to reduce the risk of future flare-ups.

Management is for children > 1 - 5 years

# Managing Steps
**Summary:**
1. Immediately, assess severity and start bronchodilator (salbutamol)
	1. Mild/moderate: Can walk and speak whole sentences in one breath
		1. Asthma is less likely to be the cause of wheezing in infants <12 months old. Monitor closely, if symptoms do not respond reconsider the diagnosis and contact a pediatrician
	2. Severe: Any of unable to speak sentences, visibly breathless, increased work of breathing, O2 sat 90-94%, use of accessory muscles of neck or intercostal muscles
	3. Life-threatening: Drowsy, collapsed, exhausted, cyanotic, poor repsiratory effort, oxygen sat <90%
	4. Consider anaphylaxis and manage if suspected
2. Within minutes: Reassess severity
	1. If mild/moderate and no improvement, arrange immediate transfer. If improved and stable, exit pathway. See [[#Secondary severity assessment]]
	2. If life-threatening, always transfer
	3. Continue bronchodilator, add IV magnesium sulfate if not
	4. Consider add-on treatment, such as Ipratropium. See [[#Add-On Treatment]]
	5. Arrange immediate transfer to higher-level care if no improvement or worsening symptoms
3. Within first hour: **ONLY CONSIDER TO** Start systemic corticosteroids
	1.  ***Avoid systemic corticosteroids in children 1-5 if mild/moderate wheezing responds to initial bronchodilator treatment***
	2. Oral prednisone, continue for **3-5 days**
	3. If oral not possible, IV hydrocortisone/methylprednisalone. Both every 6 hours on day 1, every 12 hours day 2, then once a day on day 3
	3.
4. After 1 hour: Reassess response to treatment
	1. Perform spirometry, repeat pulse oximetry
	2. If no breathing difficulty
		1. Observe for 1 hour after breathing resolves.
		2. If no breathing difficulty for more than one hour, conduct post-acute care:

		4. If there is breathing difficulty, it is considered and should follow [[#^a358ec|**persisting severe or life threatening acute asthma**]]
	3. If breathing difficulty persists:
		1. If not persisting severe or life-threatening, arrange hospital admission
		2. Continue bronchodilator and add-on treatment, and reassess after one hour
		3. If there is breathing difficulty, it is considered and should follow [[#^a358ec|**persisting severe or life threatening acute asthma**]]
	4. If breathing difficulty persists, severe or life threatening:
		1. Transfer to higher level care or discuss transfer/retrieval with senior medical staff ^a358ec

## Secondary severity assessment
When conducting secondary severity assessment of acute asthma in adults and children > 6 years, the following should be checked:

## Add-On Treatment:
Add-on treatment if needed:
