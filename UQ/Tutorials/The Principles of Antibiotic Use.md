**Aim of Antibiotic Therapy**
To help cure the patient themself of an infectious disease, but no undue danger to:
- Patient
- Environment
- Pocket [[Home]]

10 Principles of Antibiotic
1. Is an antibiotic **indicated**
2. Have appropriate **specimens** been obtained, examined and cultured?
3. What **organism(s)** is the most liekly?
4. If many agents are available, which is **best**?
5. Is an antibitic **combination** appropriate?
6. Any special **host* factors?
7. Best **route*** of administration?
8. Appropriate **dose**ï¼Ÿ
9. **Modification** of therapy when microbiological results available?
10. Optimal **duration** of Rx and any **resistance** development?

##### Urgent "probably" infections
- Focal infection ([[pneumonia]] etc.)
- Septicaemic patients
- Febrile, leukopaenics
- ? Acute endocarditis
- Bacterial meningitis
- Acute necrotizing fasciitis
- OTHERS

##### Appropriate samples
1. NNB
2. Gram stain
	1. Gram (+) vs (-), cocci vs bacilli etc.
	2. Morphology
	3. Normally sterile sites
		1. Pleiura, pericardium, meninges, peritoneum, urine
	4. Caveat
		1. Interpreting non-sterile site (e.g. wound swab)
			1. Authors opinion: If there is no pseudonomas, do not give anti-pseudonomas, as it is the first place to infect in the wound swab
3. Obtain appropriate cultures
4. Blood, fluids, exudates
	1. Conduct before /a/b Rx
	2. Done because:
		1. Later change in therapy
			1. Broad spectrum = response, how to modify Rx?

##### What is the most likely orgaism?
This is easily done if **culture data** exist. If not, empiric Rx can be done via a combination of **clinical picture** and **gram stain**

Influences on liekly pathogens:
- Focal findings
	- Meningitis
	- Gram stain
- Age
	- Meningitis
		- Nenonate vs child vs young adult vs ages
	- Impact on A/b dosage
		- Dosage tends to change, and contrindications
- Epidemiology:
		- Nosomical (ICU vs wards) has selective pressures, such as Pseudo, Stenotophomonas, MRSA, Acinetobactor, Pen R penumococci, BRE
		- Communicty acquired, including **where**
		- Prior a/b use
- Prior culture data: Can give hints on location of disease

##### Which drug of choice?
Things to consider include:
1. Obvious drug of choice
2. Allergies
3. Penetration and pH
	1. Meninges, abscess
4. Side effects
5. Bacteriocidal vs static
	1. Immunity, severity
6. Cost
	1. a/b, admin frequency, number, admin costs, route, monitoring, OPD Rx
7. Narrow vs broad spectrum
8. Dosing interval - getting longer (examples)

##### Combinating drugs?
Indications for combinating drugs include **broad spectrum**, **multiple organisms (e.g. IA sepsis), synergies such as seriel inhibition (SMX-TMP) or increased penetration (Pen + AG), or lowering resistance (Gram (-) on TB)*

##### Combinations:
1. Pen/AMpy + Genta - Step endocarditis, Enterococcal
2. Pip. +Gent - Gr (-) esp R aeroginosa
3. Cephalosoprins + AG - Klebsiella
4. Clox + Gentamycin - S auereus
5. Vancomycin + Rifampicin - S epidermidis

##### Disadvantages:
1. Increased toxicity
2. Colonisation with increases resistance
3. Antagonism - Double beta lactam, Penicillin +tet (meningitis)
4. Increased cost
5. ***FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY**

##### Special conditions to consider
###### Genetics:
1. G6-PD deficiency, affects sulfas
2. Porphyria

###### Pregnancy and lactation:
**Should avoid ALL A/B**. Examples to consider:
- Safe antibiotics:
	- Pen
	- Ceph
	- Erythro
- Caution:
	- AG
	- Vencomycin
	- Clindamycin
	- Imipenem
	- TMP
	- nitrofurantoin
- Contraindicated:
	- Chloramphenicol
	- Erythromycin estolate
	- Tetacycline
	- Quinolones
	- TMP-SMX
	- Metronidazole

##### Renal impairment:
- Choice
- Dose + Interval
- Create clearance estimate

##### Liver impairment:
- Chloramphenicol
- Clindamycin
- Euthromycin
- Cloxacillin

##### Impaired humoral and cellular function of host
- Steroids, chemoRx, radiation, transplant
- CIDAL

##### Best route of administration
| Parenteral        | Oral                                                                  | OPAT |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Serious infection | Sequential (IUV-Ral switch), in ICU as well                           |      |
|                   | Common minor infections                                               |      |
|                   | Specials with excelelnt oral absorption, TMPX-SMX, FQ's (new and old) |      |
|                   |                                                                       |      |

###### Apropriate doses
Should attemptt the **lowest effective dose**. This minimises:
1. Side effects
2. Superinfections
3. Cost

Doses change with **neonates vs children vs adults**. Certain organisms require higher doses, such as P. aeruginosa, S. aureus etc.

###### Modfication of Rx after culture results
Should consider between narrow vs broad spectrum:
1. Changes in cost, colonisation, superfinection, and resistance
2. S. aureus - Pen vs Clox vs Vancomycin
3. Gr (-) rods - AG initially but suscueptibility to Ampicllin or cephalosporin = change + stop AG
4. Multiple neg cultures
	1. Other Fx/unusual pathogens ( Legionella, TB, Mp, Chl)
5. Follow-up cultures:
	1. **Beware** of colonisation vs infection, **treat the patient, not the culture**
	2. Drug fever is common occurance, such as in:
		1. B lactams, Vancomycin, Amphotericin B
		2. Cleus - pulse rate, timing, eosinophillia, rahs

##### Optimal duration/Resistance
###### **Duration**:
- Well establised vs empiric
- Genrally - 3 days fever free
- Some infections longer
	- Endocarditis, Brain abscess, NCP, VAP, Legionella

###### Development of resitance:
Some organisms develop resistance on Rx:
1. Hosp acruiqred Gr (-) rods
	1. Pseudonomas
	2. Enterobacter
	3. Serratia
2. CNS
	1. ESKAPE
	2. Enterococcus faecium
	3. Staphylococcus aureus
	4. Klebsiella pneumoniae
	5. Acinetobacter baumannii
	6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
	7. Enterobacter species
