**Vitals:**
- Always double check with previous results possible
- Every degree change from 37, expect 10-15 change in HR
- When hot, blood is pushed peripherally to vasodilate and cool. HR compensates for loss of cardiac output, so HR increases
- Calculated risk via Q-ADDS, but risk is independent

**Infection**:
- UTI is the most common cause of [[Sepsis (and SIRS)]] or significant infections in female

[[Sepsis (and SIRS)]]:
- You get peripheral vasodilation, and young people deal with increase HR.
	- This is harder for older people, who are often beta-blocked
