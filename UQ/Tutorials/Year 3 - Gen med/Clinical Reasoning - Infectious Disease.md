## Day 2



# Information:
**Questions to ask:**
- If extended period of time, ask about prodrome
- Ask about urine changes
- Respiratory:
	- SOB
	- Cough
		- Productive
	- Runny nose
	- Sick contacts
	- Recent travel
	- Abdominal pain
	- Dysuria
	- Rash
		- Antibiotics
		- Viral illnesses
		- [[Meningitis]]
			- If petechial risk
	- Chest pain
		- Pleuritic
	- Zoonootic exposure?
		- Q-Fever
			- Not just farm time, can come from trucks containing animal
			- Time with cattle on farms
			- Tics
**Examinations**:
- Respiratory distress
- GCS
- Mucuous membranes:
	- Dry?
- Capillary refill time
- Chest:
	- Breath sounds
		- Bronchial
			- Consolidated tissue, so you are hearing the sound of the bronchials going through fluid
		- Crackles
			- IF: Course crepirations, both in inspiration and expiration. Fibrotic tissue moving around
			- [[Pneumonia]]: Alveoli normally do not stick due to surfactant. When damangd in pneumonia, surfactant gone, so the alveoli stick together, before poppoing
- Cardio, Abdo, Neuro exam

**Working diagnosis**:
- [[Pneumonia#*Community acquired pneumonia* (CAP):]] + [[Sepsis (and SIRS)]]
	- Maybe Sepsis Shock
	- This is sepsis + hypotension despite fluid resus and lactate usually >= 2.0

**Investigations**
- CXR
	- Good to have baseline
	- Presentor recommended PA and Lateral
- Urine dipstick and M/C/S
- FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP
- ABG
	- Check for gasses, such as PO2, pH, PCO2
- Sputum culture
- Blood culture x2
	- Always with time differentials, or place differentiate
- Respiratory panel
- ECG

**Vitals:**
- Always double check with previous results possible
- Every degree change from 37, expect 10-15 change in HR
- When hot, blood is pushed peripherally to vasodilate and cool. HR compensates for loss of cardiac output, so HR increases
- Calculated risk via Q-ADDS, but risk is independent

**Infection**:
- UTI is the most common cause of [[Sepsis (and SIRS)]] or significant infections in female

[[Sepsis (and SIRS)]]:
- You get peripheral vasodilation, and young people deal with increase HR.
	- This is harder for older people, who are often beta-blocked

**[[Pneumonia]]**
- Present more rapidly than 1 week, unless its Atypical [[Pneumonia]]
- Diplococci: [[Strep. Pneumonia]]
- Cocci grouped: [[Staph. Aureus]]
- Severity:
	- SMART-COP, determining use of being admitting
	- Low severity: Community
	- Moderate: In hospital
	- High: Possible for ICU
	- Red flags, any needs close clonical observation:
		- Tachypnea rr >22
		- HR > 100
		- Hypo < 90
		- acute onset confusion
		- O2 sat < 92% on RA
		- multilobar involvement on CXR
		- Blood lactate > 2mmol/L
- Typical:
- S pneumonia
- H. Infuelnza
	- Predominantly patients with COPUD
- Klebsiella, S. aureus
	- Often for [[Pneumonia#*Nosomcomial pneumonia* (including HAP):]]

- Pseudomonas
	- 	- Often for [[Pneumonia#*Nosomcomial pneumonia* (including HAP):]]
	- Rate but necrotising/destructive
Atypical:
- Mycoplasma
	- Common in young adults
- Chlamydoa
	- Found in bird droppings
- Legionella
	- Found with patients with kidney dysfunction
	- Often develop [[Hyponautremia]]. Recommend to watch [BnB Step 2 > Renal > Hyponautremia](http://10.243.109.99:8080/BnB%20Step%202/Renal%20%26%20Genitourinary/2.%20Fluids%20and%20Electrolytes/2.%20Hyponatremia%20ATF.mkv)

**CXR:**
- Costophrenic angle should still be present in [[Pneumonia]]
	- If not present, more than consolidation, likely effusion
- You know is right middle lobe if the right border of the heart is covered
- Middle lobe:
	- Lateral and medial aspect

**Management:**
- Maintain O2 sat >94%
- IV antibiotics
	- Empiric for high severity: IV ceft + IV azithromycin
	- Doxy is good for [[Q-Fever]]
- IV fluid bolus
	- Meausre BP, urine output
- Regular review/consideratre ICU if BP not fluid-responsive
	- Also, if RR persisting aboe 35
	- NIV first step to bring it down
	- Withhold antihypertensives to measure BP
- SEPSIS SIX can be useful:
	- IN
		- Oxygen to keep sats > 94%
		- IV antibiotics
		- IV fluid bolus
	- OUT
		- Lactate
		- Blood cultures
		- Urine output

**Allergy**
- [[Penicillin]], has a rash, it can be likely due to EBV present causing rash rather than allergy
	- [[Cefazolin]] covers staph and strep, but not much reactivity with penicillin which is good
	- Better kidney function than [[Flucoxicillin]]
	- Useful in surgery, normally prohylsxis first line
		- Very broad, so good for prophylactic
