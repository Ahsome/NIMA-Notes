# Overall Notes:
- Onset is **key** for diagnosis, do not skip or make it slow
- 
# Schizophrenia:
- The most important risk factor is genetics
- Other risk factors:
	- Urban birth
		- Used to think just migration to urban area (see second point)
		- Now it seems to be more than births into urban area
	- Migration
	- Cannabis use
		- Brings forward onset from 2.5-3 years, not causative
	- Childhood trauma
- Two main models:
	- Neurodevelopment disorder
		- Reduction in brain weight inversely proportional to age of onset
		- Changes in grey and white matter
		- Affects dopamine and glutamate
		- Common imaging:
			- Grey matter loss
			- White matter changes on tensor diffusion imaging
			- accelerated anges
			- Frontal and Temporal activities on functional imaging are abnormal
	- ???
- Three main biotypes
- Outcomes:
	- <50% show substantial clinical improvement in 6 years
	- Variable course
	- Predictive power is <30%
- Psychosis:
	- Catatonia:
		- isÂ **a disorder that disrupts a person's awareness of the world around them**. People with this condition sometimes react very little or not at all to their surroundings, or might behave in ways that are unusual, unexpected or unsafe to themselves or others
		- Normally focused on motor issues
- Common issue that is not differentiated out early is Delerium
	- Once identified as a possibility, many steps to diagnose
	- CXR, imaging


Hallucinations:
- Perception without stimulus
	- Important to know if it is a perception or not, as you want to avoid patient mistaking a nightmare for a hallucination, or whether they see something that looks like a snake
	- Ways to conduct perception is place an object to the patient, and see how they respond
	- Normally patient will have an emotional response to the perception
