<aside> üè• Mr MC 68yo M admitted to hospital with non-healing diabetic ulcer, sudden onset of chest pain

</aside>

## Vitals:

BP 156.88, HR 90, SaO2 94% RA, RR 22bpm, afebrile

-   Immediate investigation: ECG
    -   Bloods: troponins, FBC
    -   CXR

## On review:

Patient appears distressed, repeat observations are unchanged

### PMHx

-   T2DM, poorly controlled
-   PVD
-   Renal impairment
-   HTN
-   GORD
-   Obesity
-   Nill high cholesterol

### SHx

-   Divorced
-   Truck driver
-   3-4 beers a night
-   20 cigs/day

### FHx:

-   Father, MI, 51

### Medications

-   Insulin, Ramipril 10mg, Amlodipine 10mg

DIFFERENTIALS

## Risk Factors:

-   Male
-   Age
-   Family History, 1st degree <55yo
-   Diabetes
-   HTN
-   Smoking
-   CKD
-   Obesity

## Examination

-   ABCDE
-   Blood sugars
-   General inspection:
    -   looks unwell, distressed
    -   talking in full sentences, not confused
    -   warm, well-perfused
    -   vitals unchanged (** do quick review of trend)
-   CVS exam: normal CVS exam
-   Resp exam: normal exam except for increased RR

## Investigations:

-   **ECG**
-   ******FBC******
    -   Hb 118, WCC 10.1, Platelets 210

## Refined DDx:

### 1. ACS - typical sounding chest pain, multiple CV RF

### [[STEMI]]

**MI meds:**

ACEi/ARB

BB

Statin

SGLT2 inhibitors if diabetic - ‚Äúgliflozin‚Äù

Lifestyle education - smoking cessation

### 2. NSTE - ACS

### NSTEMI (w/ initial management):

1.  Oxygen is sats <94
2.  Sublingual GTN if systolic BP>90
3.  Aspirin (300mg loading dose - if no CI/ not already taking)
4.  Consider analgesia (morphine, fentanyl)
5.  Call for senior review - cardio review
6.  To consider:
    1.  Does the patient need to go to CCU?
    2.  Does patient need angiogram (contraindications for angiogram e.g. mental health issues)
    3.  Does patient have any risks or coagulation for antiplatelet/anticoag e.g. brain haemorrhage, alcohol liver disease‚Ä¶etc.
    4.  Not recommended to administer routine pre-treatment with P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in NSTE - ACS patients in whom coronary anatomy is unknown and early invasive therapy is planned
7.  Other considerations?
    1.  Lipids control, high dose statin
    2.  HbA1c to optimise diabetes

### Unstable angina

### 3. PE - hospitalised patient, in bed

1.  jj

### 4. GORD

1.  kk

### 5. [[Pneumonia]]? hospitalised patient

1.  kk

# Summary:

-   Cardiac chest pain indicative of ischaemia
-   Associated with dyspnea and nausea
-   Often not described as pain, use term discomfort
-   Often less diagnosed in women
-   Family history cut-off: males before the age of 60, females 55 (e.g. if father had MI at age of 80, it is not as big of a family history risk factor)
-   If patient has hx of CAD, ask if pain is similar to angina, or if it is different
-   Bleeding risk
-   Do ******not****** give nitrates to hypotensive patient, would exacerbate further
-   Consider lifestyle modifications after treatment
-   SCAD - spontaneous coronary artery dissection
-   Extra DDx:
    -   Myocardial injury = type 2 MI
        -   Elevation of cardiac troponin only, with no evidence if plaque rupture
        -   Severe HTN
        -   Sustained tachyarrhythmia ‚Äî> troponin rise
    -   Myocardial infarction = plaque rupture ‚Äî> ischaemia
    -   Chronic myocardial injury - CKD, structural heart disease
