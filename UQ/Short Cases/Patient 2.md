[[STEMI]] - ‚Äútombstones‚Äù with acute pulmonary oedema

## Risk Factors:

-   ???

## Examination

-   HSD pansystolic murmer

-   ASNT
-   No peripheral oedema
-   Weak but palpable pedal pulses

## Investigations:

-   **ECG**
-   ## ******FBC******
    

## Refined DDx:

### 1. ACS - typical sounding chest pain, multiple CV RF

### [[STEMI]]

![[STEMI#*How to diagnose*]]

? How to diagnose - chest pain and ST elevation in 2 contiguous leads

-   > 2mm in chest leads and >1mm in limb leads
    
-   Posterior MI - ST-depression in leads V1-3 and utilise V7-9 ST-elevation>0.5mm

![[STEMI#_**Management:**_]]

_**Management:**_

-   Continuous ECG monitoring/crash cart
-   IV access
-   Aspirin 300mg
-   Nitrates if systolic BP.90
-   Narcotic and antiemetic
-   Consider diuretic if in APO
-   REPERFUSION:
    -   Urgent angiogram: PCI capable centre within 120mins of first medical contact (FMC:EMS)
    -   Thrombolysis in a non-PCI capable hospital (within 90mins of FMC) and transfer to PAH
    -   Indications:
        -   [[STEMI]]
        -   New LBBB

_Long-term plan_

-   Dual anti-platelets usually for 12months but cardiologist will guide
    -   Aspirin life-long)
-   Echocardiogram - LV function, valves, complications
    -   ACEi if LV dysfunction
    -   If HFrEF ‚Äî> initiate and titrate HF therapies with mortality benefits
-   Risk factors:
    -   Lipid panel
        -   Rosuvastatin 40mg / atorvastatin 80mg
        -   Aim for LDL <1.4mmHg
    -   HbA1c
    -   Blood Pressure, optimise BP with ACE-I first line
    -   Structured cardiac rehab programme - smoking cessation, improve diet and regular exercise, depression

**MI meds:**

ACEi/ARB

BB

Statin

SGLT2 inhibitors if diabetic - ‚Äúgliflozin‚Äù

Lifestyle education - smoking cessation

### 2. NSTE - ACS

### NSTEMI (w/ initial management):

1.  Oxygen is sats <94
2.  Sublingual GTN if systolic BP>90
3.  Aspirin (300mg loading dose - if no CI/ not already taking)
4.  Consider analgesia (morphine, fentanyl)
5.  Call for senior review - cardio review
6.  To consider:
    1.  Does the patient need to go to CCU?
    2.  Does patient need angiogram (contraindications for angiogram e.g. mental health issues)
    3.  Does patient have any risks or coagulation for antiplatelet/anticoag e.g. brain haemorrhage, alcohol liver disease‚Ä¶etc.
    4.  Not recommended to administer routine pre-treatment with P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in NSTE - ACS patients in whom coronary anatomy is unknown and early invasive therapy is planned
7.  Other considerations?
    1.  Lipids control, high dose statin
    2.  HbA1c to optimise diabetes

### Unstable angina

### 3. PE - hospitalised patient, in bed

1.  jj

### 4. GORD

1.  kk

### 5. [[Pneumonia]]? hospitalised patient

# Summary:

1.  Rule of thumb for diagnosing [[STEMI]]: >2mm increase in chest leads, >1mm in limb leads. More specific diagnosis:
    1.  _V2-V3:_
        1.  > 2.5mm in men < 40yo
            
        2.  > 2mm in men ‚â• 40yo
            
        3.  > 1.5mm in women
            
2.  For inferior MI, consider right precordial leads (V3R and V4R), as this can be a concomitant RV infarction
3.  For Posterior MI, look for ST-segment depression in V1-V3
4.  For a ************[[STEMI]]. patient needs reperfusion, and should not be delated for investigations************
    1.  _PCI capable centre_: Urgent angiogram, w/ wire crossing
    2.  _Non-PCI capable hospital_: Thrombolysis, w/ lytic bolus
5.  Subsequent management include:
    1.  Monitor and treat **arrhtmias**
    2.  **Dual antiplatelets**
    3.  Complete an **echo**
    4.  Minimise ************************risk factors************************
