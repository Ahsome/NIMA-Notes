- Bradycardia = < 60 bpm
- Tachycardia = > 100 bpm
- PR interval 120-200ms (~3-5 squares)
- Q waves are pathological > 2mm deep
- QRS complex 70-120ms (~3 squares)

![[Pasted image 20231102144828.png]]
# Rate
-  Count squares between complexes and divide by 300
- Multiply the number of complexes on the rhythm strip by 6

# Rhythm
- Easiest to assess in lead 2
- Regular
- Irregular
	- Regularly irregular or irregularly irregular 
- ![[Pasted image 20231102144139.png]]
- The above is irregularly irregular 

# Axis
- Look at leads 1, 2 and aVF
- Away "leaving" = left, towards "arriving" = right

# Cases

![[Pasted image 20231102150651.png]]
- Rate: 30bpm
- Rhythm: regular
- Axis: RAD
- Multiple downward pointing T waves
- PR interval has no consistency
- QT interval >600ms
- QRS interval >100ms
Dx: 3rd degree heart block


![[Pasted image 20231102150752.png]]
- Rate: Around 80bpm
- Rhythm: Irregularly irregular
- Axis: LAD
- Absence of discernable P waves
- Downward T waves I, and aVL, possible hyperacute T waves V2 and V3, upward T wave in V1
- PR interval not able to be calculated
- ST segment changes are abnormal but likely secondary to hyperacute T waves
Dx: AFib with underlying ischaemic disease


![[Pasted image 20231102151206.png]]
- Rate: ~150
- Rhythm: Irregularly irregular
- Axis: Normal
- ?? CASE 4  ????
Dx: AF

**Clear Ventricular Fibrillation in a patient in cardiac arrest**
Identify that this is an unstable and shockable rhythm immediately, and then we can move in to examining the other details
- Rate: This is a pulse-less rhythm by definition. There are unlikely to be effective ventricular contractions and no defined QRS complexes
- Rhythm: Irregularly irregular
- Axis: Not discernible 


![[Pasted image 20231102151851.png]]**This is a clear case of VT.**
While the patient is not in a "pulse-less" VT, they are clearly unstable if they are unconscious and have a BP of 60/30
Think ALS algorithm
- Rate: >150bpm
- Rhythm: Regular
- Axis: Unknown - As there is no isoelectric line and a purely ventricular rhythm it is impossible to determine an axis


![[Pasted image 20231102152103.png]]
- Rate: 150bpm
- Rhythm: Regular
- Axis: RAD - lead 1 downward, aVF upward; suggestive of RAD
- P waves are not able to be identified, likely due to having the QRS superimposed
- PR interval cannot be calculated
- QRS is narrow
Dx: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) - Narrow complex tachycardia suggests that this is supraventricular in nature
- A fixed rate of 150 bpm suggests the same, but is not enough to make a diagnosis
- Despite the absence of clear P waves, this is due to the overlying QRS complex and this is still an atrial rhythm


![[Pasted image 20231102152600.png]]
- Rate: 60bpm
- Rhythm: Regular
- Axis: LAD
- P wave morphology is normal
- P waves are not each followed by a QRS complex
- T waves can not be seen due to frequent P waves and QRS complexes
Dx: Atrial flutter


![[Pasted image 20231102152832.png]]
- Rate: 90bpm
- Rhythm: Regular
- Axis: Mild LAD
- ST depression I, II, ~aVF, V4-6
- ST Elevation in aVR
Dx: STEMI


![[Pasted image 20231102153120.png]]
- Rate: ~60bpm
- Rhythm: Regular
- Axis: Normal
- ST Elevation I, aVL, V2-V6
- ST Depression III, aVF
Dx: Anterior STEMI


![[Pasted image 20231102153403.png]]
- Rate: ~90bpm
- Rhythm: Regular
- Axis: Normal
- Widespread ST changes with saddling of the complexes and PR depression
Dx: Pericarditis
