# Ticks and tick-borne diseases
- Paralysis tick (Ixodes Holocylus)
	- 1cm long
	- Long grasses and bushland, humid climate
	- Redness + swelling around tick bite w/paralysis or anaphylaxis
		- Rash, headache, fever, flu-like, photophobia, weakness
- Other ticks:
	- Queensland tick typhus (Rickettsia australis) is found along Australia’s eastern seaboard as far south as Victoria
		- Eschar at bite site, petechial and maculopapular rash, myalgias, fever, headache
		- Diagnosed with Rickettsia/Orientia PCR or Serology 
		- Mx: Doxycycline 100mg BD for 7/7
		- Prevention: Diethyltoluamide = DEET, wear PPE,
	- Flinders Island spotted fever is found in south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania
	- Scrub typhus is found in the northern parts of Australia
	- These are mild illnesses with fever, rash, myalgia, headache and lymphadenopathy
- Lyme disease
	- Erythema migrans (annular red rash)


### Tick removal:
1. Use only fine tipped forceps and avoid squeezing the body of the tick
2. Tweezer tips should be on or as close to the tick head as possible
3. Pull upwards with slow, steady motion
4. OR CRYOTHERAPY OR PERMETHRIN CREAM
5. Also need to check tetanus status and clean the site with antiseptic 


# Mosquito-borne illnesses

- Flood conditions and lots of. rainfall increases risk to mosquitos
- Tx: wash area with soap and water. and apply antiseptic.  Ice can hep with pain and swelling
- Insect repellent containing DEET or Picaridin to protect against mozzie bites, or outdoor mosquito coils  
### Ross River Virus and Barmah Forest Virus
- Arbovirus - most notification rate 
- Incubation period from 3-21days 
- Symptoms for up to 6mo: fever, fatigue, headaches, lymphadenopathy, polyarthralgia, exanthem with rash
- ![[Pasted image 20231101140447.png]]
- RRV, BFV serology with IgM initially and IgG later
- Mx:  paracetamol, NSAIDs

### Dengue
- Aedes egypti mosquito 
- 4 types of dengue virus
- Symptoms: sudden onset fever, headahce behind eyes, myalgia,  N/V, fine skin rash, fatigue
- Haemorrhagic fever in some --> dengue shock syndrome 
	- DSS: restlessness, cold clammy skin, rapid weak pulse,  pulse pressure  <20mmHg
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101141027.png]]
- Dengue PCR --> Dengue IgM --> Dengue IgG after 8 days
- Mx: fluids, paracetamol. ==AVOID anti-inflammatories (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen) as it increases bleeding==
- Vaccine currently in trial but. otherwise, avoid mosquitoes. and be careful when travelling

# Other tropical diseases
- Hyatid disease 
	- Caused by cysts containing arva of Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm (dog tapeworm)
	- Can be asymptomatic for decades
	- Hepatomegaly. common, otherwise lung cysts
	- Tx: surgery + albendazole 
	- Avoid contact with infected dogs, dingoes and foxes
- Strongyloidiasis
	- Can be asymptomatic even after decades
	- FBC: eosinophilia 
	- Tx: stat ivermectin 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101141740.png]]
- Naegleria fowleri
	- Amoeba commonly found in warm freshwater and soil
	- Breaches cribiform plate and infects olfactory nerves and then brain
	- Encephalitis and meningitis 
- Daintree (Buruli) ulcer
	- Microbacterium ulcerans --> severe skin and limb damage 
	- Painless lump often mistaken for insect bite --> forms an ulcer after 1-2 months 
- Scabies
	- Sarcoptes scabei - mites burrow under the skin to lay eggs, especially between fingers, folds of armpit and elbow, groin, butt crease, wrists 
	- Tropical areas with co-existing poverty and overcrowding 
	- Intense itching and red rash with tiny red bumps
	- Itching is worse at night or after a hot bath or shower 
	- Very contagious
	- Tx: 5% permethrin cream
