# General CXR notes:
- Most CXRs in trauma setting are done AP (supine) due to trauma, therefore the mediastinum may appear falsely enlarged 
- **In trauma X-rays you should be looking for the following:**
	- ==tension pneumothorax== - tracheal deviation away from PTX
	- ==simple pneumothorax== - >2cm lung edge deviation is considered large
	- ==massive haemothorax== - blunting of costophrenic angle
	- ==pulmonary oedema== - batwings, increased cardiac size, Kerley B lines
	- ==thoracic aortic injury== - widened mediastinum with deviation of the trachea to the right, depression of the left main bronchus, and increased density of the left hemithorax consistent with haemothorax
	- ==traumatic diaphragmatic rupture== - herniation of abdominal contents into thorax
	- ==free air under diaphragm ==- due to bowel perforation
	- unstable C-spine 
	- open-book pelvic fracture
	- ==ETT positioning== - should be located in trachea 5cm above carina 
- To check for emergency management:
	- Tension pneumothorax decompression
	- Massive haemothorax drainage
	- Tube and catheter placement  
	    - endotracheal tube  
	    - chest tube  
	    - nasogastric tube
- DO NOT USE FOR:
	- Situations where CXR won't change management
	- URTI
	- Uncomplicated asthma or COPD
	- Routine follow-up for pneumonia is <50yrs and non-smoker 
	- Lung cancer screening

| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
|There is a time lag in the development of some acute x-ray changes|Can't clear c-spine or sit patient up --> supine AP underestimate PTX or HTX|
|- Aspiration of blood, gastric fluid, water, oil – up to 2 hours  |
|- Pulmonary contusions – up to 6 hours|Pain - unable to stay still - poor positioning or rotation|
|      | Artefacts from ECG leads, tubing, spinal boards                              |
|      | Paediatric patients - thymus <3yrs, physiological tracheal deviation <5yrs   |

### How to interpret a CXR
![[Pasted image 20231101161219.png]]
* Inspiration = roughy 8-10 posterior ribs 

### Subacute CXR
- Pleural effusion - left lower zone is uniformly white and meniscus sign (the fluid spreads out when patient is supine)
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101185125.png]]
- Consolidation - opacification
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101185210.png]]
	- **Basic DDx for acute consolidation**
		- Pneumonia – e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal
		- Aspiration – e.g. blood, gastric fluid, water, oil
		- Pulmonary oedema – e.g. heart failure, pulmonary embolism, ARDS, inhaled toxins, intracranial bleed
		- Pulmonary haemorrhage / contusion / infarction
	- **Basic DDx for chronic consolidation**
		- Neoplastic – due to obstructive lung cancer, lymphoma
		- Inflammatory – e.g. sarcoidosis, eosinophilic pneumonia
		- Infective – e.g. tuberculosis, fungal infection
- Aortic dissection - widened mediastinum, double aortic contour or irregular aortic contour 
- Malignancy
- Posterior rib fractures in child abuse
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101185420.png]]
- Atelectasis 

### Differentials:
![[Pasted image 20231101185831.png]]
- 58yo M smoker presenting with chronic cough, finger clubbing and 10kg weight-loss over 6months = neoplasm
- 58yo M power station worker with moderate chest pain after a cylinder exploded 30m away from him = lung contusion/haemorrhage 
- 58yo M with epilepsy and an acquired brain injury who is febrile 24hr after a generalised tonic-clonic seizure = aspiration pneumonia 


# C-spine X-ray
- Normal trauma c-spine x-ray series does not mean “fine, no problems”
- Often need a CT if suspicion of injury or poor visualisation or can’t clear clinically
- For patients who can’t be evaluated (unconscious / intubated), options include  
    - continue c-spine immobilisation until they can tell you they are asymptomatic  
    - having MRI within 48 hours of injury then if normal, discontinuing immobilisation
- Patients with ankylosing spondylitis need CT ± MRI, even after minor trauma

### Should we do imaging?
- High risk factors that mandate cervical spine imaging:
	- age ≥ 65 years
	- dangerous mechanisms of injury (e.g. high-velocity car crash)
	- sensory neurologic deficit
- Low risk factors:
	- simple rear-end collisions
	- able to sit
	- ambulatatory at any time
	- delayed onset of neck pain
	- absence of midline cervical tenderness

### Unstable fractures:
*Jefferson bit off a hangman's thumb*
- **Jefferson** C1 burst fracture of atlas
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101201618.png]]
- **Bi**lateral facet dislocation. - often shows increased interspinous distance
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101201726.png]]
- **O**dontoid types 2 and 3 - fracture through the dens of odontoid
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101201755.png]]
- **A**tlantoaxial (or atlantooccipital dislocation)
- **Hangman’s** bilateral C2 pedicle fracture - is a result of hyperextension and distraction
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101201841.png]]
- **T**eardrop fracture – flexion - occur at lower spine around C4/5/6 creating a classic triangular anterior fragment (teardrop) which is minimally displaced

### Lateral view

### AP view

### Odontoid / Open-mouth view
![[Pasted image 20231101201106.png]]

### To assess C-spine:
1. A - alignment of anterior and posterior vertebral lines, spinolaminal line,  posterior spinous line 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20231101201224.png]]
2. Bones
	1. ![[Pasted image 20231101201237.png]]
3. Cartilage (discs) should be equal in hight, symmetrical, equal
	1. ![[Pasted image 20231101201313.png]]
4. Soft tissue swelling - An easy way to remember this is no more than 7mm at c2 and no more than 2cm at c7
	1. ![[Pasted image 20231101201400.png]]

# Pelvic X-ray
- Bimodal distribution with younger male patients involved in high-energy trauma and older female patients presenting after minor trauma
- Pelvic binder recommended in open-book fractures to prevent bleeding, but not in lateral compression fracture 
- AP pelvis view examines the iliac crest, sacrum, proximal femur, pubis, ischium and the great pelvic ring
- Life-threatening fractures: open book pelvic fracture, vertical shear fracture
- Other disasters –   e.g. dislocated hips, traumatic proximal femoral fracture
- Management at a trauma centre may require;
	- External fixation by an orthopaedic surgeon
	- Angiography and embolisation by an interventional radiologist
	- Pre-peritoneal pelvic packing to achieve haemostasis by trauma surgeon or emergency physician
- ABCS approach:
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101202514.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101202535.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101202550.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101202711.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101202656.png]]

# Abdominal X-ray 
- Indications:
	- Perforated hollow viscus / free air
	- Bowel obstruction
	- Ingested radio-opaque foreign body
	- Penetrating injury / renal tract calculi (not covered)

### Views
- Basal lung fields and pubic bones should be immages

# Extremity X-ray
### To note:
- Be aware of child abuse
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101205433.png]]

### ABCS for assessment
- Alignment
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101205118.png]]
- Bones - pay attention to cortical outline of each bone for fractures and look for differences in density/texture for osteopenia 
- Cartilage and joints 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101205212.png]]
- Soft tissue and foreign bodies 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101205249.png]]

### Rule of 2s
- 2 views
- 2 joints (above and below a long bone)
- 2 sides (if difficult or for children)
- 2 occasions (compare with old films if available)
- 2 times (pre- and post-procedure or after time interval)

### Communication:
- Epiphysis/metaphysis/diaphysis - proximal/middle/distal third of diaphysis shaft 
- Buckle, bowing, greenstick, complete - transverse/spiral/oblique
- Is the fracture displaced or undisplaced
