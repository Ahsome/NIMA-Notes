| Keratoacanthoma |![[Pasted image 20231024123141.png]]|- fast-growing then resolving (~12 week period) symmetrical cup-shaped lesions with a central crater filled with keratin, sharply circumscribed, tending to occur on sun damaged skin|           |
| Bowen's Disease |![[Pasted image 20231024123221.png]]|- sharply defined, erythematous, round-to-oval scaling hyperkeratotic plaque in non-light exposed areas of skin|           |
|SCC|![[Pasted image 20231024123125.png]]|- scaling lesion with erythematous base and induration, thickening or tenderness|           |


# Benign lesions
- Freckles’ – ephelides, lentigines
- ‘Moles’ – benign melanocytic naevi
	- ![[Pasted image 20231024123611.png]]

# Benign VS Malignant 
Benign lesions sow symmetry of colour and structure - ignore shape

 ![[Pasted image 20231024124454.png]]

### 3-point checklist:
1. Asymmetry: asymmetry of colour and structure in one or two perpendicular axes
2. Atypical network: pigment network with irregular holes and thick lines
3. Blue-white structures: any type of blue and/or white colour, i.e. combination of blue-white veil and regression structures
![[Pasted image 20231024124539.png]]

### Chaos and Clues
![[Pasted image 20231024124620.png]]
1. Grey or blue structures
2. Eccentric structureless area
3. Thick lines, reticular or branched
4. Black dots or clods, peripheral
5. Lines radial or pseudopods, segmental
6. White lines
7. Polymorphous vessels
8. Lines parallel, ridges (acral) or chaotic (nails) 
9. Polygons

![[Pasted image 20231024124710.png]]

### Exceptions:
1. Changing lesions on adults, especially with increasing age, with either historic or dermatoscopic evidence of change (peripheral clods, radial lines or pseudopods)
2. Nodular lesions or very small lesions with any clue to malignancy
3. Head/Neck: pigmented circles or dermatoscopic grey colour
4. Lesions on palms or soles (acral) with a parallel ridge pattern


## Treatments
### Cryotherapy
![[Pasted image 20231025002542.png]]

### Fluorouracil cream (5%)
solar keratoses
causes lots if inflm

### **Imiquimod cream (5%)**
solar keratoses and BCC

### **Photodynamic therapy**
Bowen's disease, solar keratoses and BCC
painful

### **Radiotherapy**
good adjunctive therapy

### **Curettage & cautery**

Curettage and cautery is a type of electrosurgery in which a skin lesion is scraped off and heat is applied to the skin surface
Seborrhoeric keratosis, KA, Bowens, BCCs, warts, skin tags
