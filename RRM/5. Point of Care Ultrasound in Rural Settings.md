# General notes
- USS is the use of high-frequency sound waves (>20KH)
- Fresh blood is anechoic = black
- Overall, a curvilinear probe is useful for most applications
	- 5cm for anterior lung (pneumothorax)
	- 15cm for haemothorax and haemoperitoneum
	- 20cm for subcostal heart
- Ensure probe is perpendicular to skin
- Why we should use?
	- Traumatic cardiac tamponade and massive haemothorax may be rapidly fatal if not detected and treated in the ED
	- Physical examination is unreliable for detection of cardiac tamponade / PTX / HTX and haemoperitoneum in the ED setting
	- Easy to use
	- Ultrasound can be used to guide emergent pericardiocentesis and intercostal catheter placement
- CONTRAINDICATIONS:
	- the presence of a more pressing problem (such as airway obstruction)
	- a clear indication for emergency laparotomy (in which case FAST is not indicated): eg stab to abdomen and shocked
- Not all injuries can be visualised
	- No ionising radiation, so can be used in children and pregnant patients
	- Remember timing - a very early scan may be falsely negative as sufficient intra-abdominal blood may not have collected in the dependent areas. Furthermore, occasionally a late scan may be falsely negative as clotted blood is of similar echogenicity to liver and may not be easily identified in Morison’s pouch
	- Be aware that epicardial fat can mimic pericardial effusion in obese patients. 
	- Be aware that retroperitoneal bleeding is very hard to detect and not always possible.
	- Be especially aware about the fact that the biggest limitation is an operator who is not able to perform the correct standard views and lacks knowledge of the pathologies he or she can detect.

### eFAST
- eFAST = extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma 
	- Know that free fluid sinks and collects in certain anatomical sites and free air rises
- **The five areas reviewed are**
	- Cardiac Views
	- Posterior bladder/Pouch of Douglas
	- Liver/Morison’s Pouch
	- Spleen/Koller Pouch
	- Lung window for pneumothorax

### Where does fluid collect in supine position?
**The amount of fluid** is important in the pleural and peritoneal spaces, but less so in the pericardium  

- Haemothorax - blood collects posteriorly, therefore the further back you place the probe, the sooner you'll see it
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101215557.png]]
- Haemopericardium - blood collects first below the left side of the heart and may start to separate the visceral from parietal pericardium
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101215651.png]]
- Haemoperitoneum
	- RUQ - free fluid will first collect around liver in supine position
		- Morison’s pouch (between the liver and the right kidney)  
		- The anterior recess (in front of the liver tip)  
		- Between the diaphragm and the liver (supbphrenic space)
		- ![[Pasted image 20231101215812.png]]
	- LUQ - free fluid may collect around here
		- Between the diaphragm and the spleen (supbphrenic space)  
		- The lienorenal interface (between the spleen and left kidney)
		- ![[Pasted image 20231101215857.png]]
- Pelvis - free fluid will collect in Pouch of Douglas (retrovesical pouch in male) deep to the bladder

**What does this mean?  
a.** Pericardial blood collects rapidly in trauma. The pericardium doesn’t have time to stretch to accommodate it. You don’t need much to cause a tamponade.  
**b.** There’s more room to move in the pleural and peritoneal spaces. So if you see just a tiny bit of fluid in these spaces in a shocked patient, then look elsewhere for the cause of the shock.  
**c.** The only exception is patients that have not been lying flat- eg the shocked patient with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy may have only a little free fluid in Morison’s Pouch. That’s because she has been standing up and all the fluid is in the pelvis.

1. Perihepatic / RUQ - between ribs 10-11 on right mid-axillary line
	- **Scan all the way through kidney and down to tip of liver and as much of the hemidiaphragm as possible (tip: ask the patient to take a deep breath)**
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102081839.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102082035.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102082053.png]]
2. Perisplenic / LUQ - splenorenal recess (Koller's space)
	- Probe on left side ribs 9-11 and on the posterior axillary line
	- **If you still can’t find the spleen, ask the patient to take a deep breath and _hold it_ while you do the scan at full inspiration**

3. Suprapubic (pelvis)
	- Fluid-filled bladder is an acoustic window, so scan before inserting catheter if possible 
	- Scan in two planes - transverse and sagittal (90 degrees to each other)
	- Risk of mirroring artefacts on either side of bladder - make sure you scan all the way through the bladder

4. Subxiphoid (pericardial)
	- Aim transducer towards left shoulder (15degrees), almost flat towards abdominal wall
	- Fresh blood will appear as a back stripe around the heart, but old clotted blood will appear grey
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102082205.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102082357.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102082444.png]]
5. Anterior thorax (bilateral lungs)
	- Anterior chest wall about mid-clavicular line
	- When the lung edge is visualised a sliding motion of the lung should be observed with the ‘twinkling artefact’ or small comet tail artefacts, and can be described as watching a line of tiny ants crawling.
	- **In the presence of a pneumothorax,** **you will still see the white line of pleura – you will not see the sliding movement,** **or the twinkling artefacts that occur with a normal lung.**
	- Absence of pleural sliding--the “shimmering” or “ants marching” appearance - is characteristic of a pneumothorax.

## False Negative and False Positive scans

**Always remember to repeat the scan if a stable patient becomes unstable**
