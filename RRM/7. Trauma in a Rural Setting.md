# General
- Major trauma is defined as some physical injury that involves real or potential threat to life and/or limb

# DRSABC
### Danger
- Environmental dangers
- Traffic
- Patient blood, infection, toxins
- Water or spills
- Foreign bodies
- Environmental exposure- heat stress/stroke
- Snake bit envenomation
- Community interactions i.e. hostile family, media, on-lookers etc.

### Response
![[Pasted image 20231102190528.png]]
- If GCS is low ( < 8) posture patient supine to enable airway management 
- Prepare to manage vomiting 
- If patient is maintaining their airway without assistance, and there are no contraindications due to other injuries,  posturing the patient at 30 degrees will facilitate breathing

**APVU** - Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, Unresponsive 

### Send help
- If first responder at MVA  - call 000
- Working in rural hospital – **RSQ**/ **TEMSU**
- In Secondary/Tertiary hospital ED – ‘trauma call’

### Airway
- ****Airway WITH C-spine precautions**
- The airway must be:
	1. Patent (open and not obstructed)
	2. Protected from aspiration (GCS < 8 Airway unprotected)
- ![[Pasted image 20231102230518.png]]
- Airway management:
	- Inspect the airway for foreign bodies (Solid food bolus, teeth, marbles, toys…) remove with Magill forceps
	- Inspect Oropharynx for blood, vomit and secretions – suction oropharynx very gently, under direct vision, only if required
	- Head Tilt (avoid in trauma with c-spine concerns)
	- Chin Lift (avoid in trauma with c-spine concerns)
	- Jaw Thrust
	- OPA/NPA airway adjuncts 
	- In a conscious patient, do not instrument - instead stand back and allow them to manage their own airway e.g. sniffing the morning air position
	- ETT (performed by doctor) or LMA (laryngeal mask airway) performed by others
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102230927.png]]
	- **Better to ventilate e.g. bag-valve mask than repeated failed attempts to intubate**

### Breathing 
![[Pasted image 20231102231348.png]]
- **Distressed conscious patients will try to sit up, patients with tension pneumothorax are often combative complaining they can’t breathe.**
- Minute volume = RR x tidal volume
