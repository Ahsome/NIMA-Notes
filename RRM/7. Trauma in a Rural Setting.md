# General
- Major trauma is defined as some physical injury that involves real or potential threat to life and/or limb
- Treatments:
	- Analgesia – beware side effects of different compounds 
	- Tranexamic acid – see CRASH 2 trial – a game changer 
	- Tetanus vaccine? 
	- Antibiotics? 
	- Gentle debridement of grossly contaminated wounds prior to dressing 
	- Grossly deformed limbs? 
		- Urgent reduction and splinting, especially of long bones
		- Stem bleeding 
		- Provide analgesia

### Danger
- Environmental dangers
- Traffic
- Patient blood, infection, toxins
- Water or spills
- Foreign bodies
- Environmental exposure- heat stress/stroke
- Snake bit envenomation
- Community interactions i.e. hostile family, media, on-lookers etc.

### Response
![[Pasted image 20231102190528.png]]
- If GCS is low ( < 8) posture patient supine to enable airway management 
- Prepare to manage vomiting 
- If patient is maintaining their airway without assistance, and there are no contraindications due to other injuries,  posturing the patient at 30 degrees will facilitate breathing

**APVU** - Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, Unresponsive 

### Send help
- If first responder at MVA  - call 000
- Working in rural hospital – **RSQ**/ **TEMSU**
- In Secondary/Tertiary hospital ED – ‘trauma call’

### Airway
- ****Airway WITH C-spine precautions**
- The airway must be:
	1. Patent (open and not obstructed)
	2. Protected from aspiration (GCS < 8 Airway unprotected)
- ![[Pasted image 20231102230518.png]]
- Airway management:
	- Inspect the airway for foreign bodies (Solid food bolus, teeth, marbles, toys…) remove with Magill forceps
	- Inspect Oropharynx for blood, vomit and secretions – suction oropharynx very gently, under direct vision, only if required
	- Head Tilt (avoid in trauma with c-spine concerns)
	- Chin Lift (avoid in trauma with c-spine concerns)
	- Jaw Thrust
	- OPA/NPA airway adjuncts 
	- In a conscious patient, do not instrument - instead stand back and allow them to manage their own airway e.g. sniffing the morning air position
	- ETT (performed by doctor) or LMA (laryngeal mask airway) performed by others
	- ![[Pasted image 20231102230927.png]]
	- **Better to ventilate e.g. bag-valve mask than repeated failed attempts to intubate**

### Breathing 
![[Pasted image 20231102231348.png]]
- **Distressed conscious patients will try to sit up, patients with tension pneumothorax are often combative complaining they can’t breathe.**
- Minute volume = RR x tidal volume
- ![[Pasted image 20231103100512.png]]
- Always give oxygen in trauma cases
	- Hudson Mask - 30% O2 (FiO2 0.3) 
	- Non Rebreather Mask - 60% O2 ( FiO2 0.6) 
	- Must have flow of > 12 litres per minute to prevent rebreathing of CO2. 
	- BVM - 70-80% O2 (FiO2 0.7 -0.8) 
	- CMV - 100% O2 (FiO2 1.0)
- If respirations are shallow & ineffectual – BVM with synchronised assisted Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV)
- Non Invasive ventilation is very useful e.g. CPAP, BiPAP, Optiow 
- Invasive ventilation – Intubation & ventilation – paralysing the patient, takes full control of the ventilation but you must be able to intubate.

### Inadequate ventilation in the trauma patient
- A significant head injury with altered level of consciousness will depress respiration. Assisted ventilation will be required. 
- Pneumothorax or Haemopneumothorax will impair ventilation – these should be drained with intercostal catheters 
- Flail Chest (especially with a large fail segment) will impair ventilation due to loss of integrity of the chest wall. The patient may require early assisted ventilation including intubation and ventilation. 
	- Flail segment may only become evident a significant time interval 
	- Flail segment is often associated with underlying pulmonary contusion which further impairs gas exchange
- While included under breathing, a ==tension pneumothorax== will rapidly kill the patient by impairing venous return to the heart.
	- DECOMPRESS THE CHEST IMMEDIATELY
	- ICC- Chest decompression in either the 2nd ICS MCL or 4th ICS just anterior to Mid axillary line.

### Circulation
- ![[Pasted image 20231103101655.png]]
- Inadequate perfusion VS shock 
	- Haemorrhagic – vasculature and fluid – surgery, IV fluids and blood 
	- Hypovolaemic – vasculature and fluid – IV fluids
		- Start with Normal Saline 4 mls/kg/ % burns from time of injury (Modied Parkland formula)
		- Adjust IV uid infusion to achieve Urine Output 0.5-1.0ml/kg/hr. 
	- Cardiogenic – pump – treat arrhythmias, inotropes, reperfusion therapy 
		- CPR in cardiac arrest 
		- Inotropic drug support e.g. noradrenaline 3mg in 50ml normal saline
	- Septic (a form of distributive) – vasculature and pump impairment - IV Fluids and inotropes, antibiotics 
		- IV antibiotics
		- fluid 10-20ml/kg fluid bolus and repeat x2 aiming for adequate cerebral perfusion and improving urine output 0.5-1ml/kg/hr 
	- Distributive – vasculature - adrenaline
		- Adult 0.5mg-1mg IM
		- Child 0.01mg/kg 
- Compress any external bleeding point 
- IV Fluids Normal Saline 10 - 20 mls /kg. Repeat x 2, reassessing perfusion 
- Blood –Packed Red Cells- O Neg or Group Specific in an emergency 
- In the head injured patient, aim for an adequate cerebral perfusion (MAP 90 mmHg) i.e. enough fluid. 
- Avoid hypotension in the head injured patient - a single episode of hypotension doubles the mortality. It can be difficult keeping the BP up while trying to avoid a catastrophic uncontrolled haemorrhage

### Disability
- AVPU until formal GCS 
- Reassess GCS 
- Signs of head trauma – may not be external signs  
- Significantly elevated temperatures can affect clinical outcomes – treat with antipyretics 
- ==Pupillary size and reaction== 
- Check ==BSL== and treat appropriately 
- Beware Hypothermia 
	- Remember the “Triad of death” ==metabolic acidosis + coagulopathy + hypothermia = Death== ……keep patient warm

### Exposure 
- Log roll to check for occult injuries once basic haemodynamic stability achieved
- Roll once haemodynamically stable 

### Imaging
- eFAST or x-rays


# Secondary Survey 
- Head to toe examination for all patients - both medical and trauma 
- Think of the system and the anatomical area you are examining to determine a diagnosis 
- Documentation of all assessment and injuries
