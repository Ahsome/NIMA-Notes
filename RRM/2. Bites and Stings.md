# Snake bites
- Majority of snakebites will NOT result in envenomation
![[Pasted image 20231025005419.png]]

1. DRSABCD
2. Ensure effective PBI (pressure bandage immobilisation)
	1. Use a broad bandage
	2. Bandage distall to proxima
	3. Splint their arm
	4. Keep them calm and steady
	5. Do not wash the wound
	6. Do not take off clothes
	7. Remove watches and rings 
3. Check bite site - swelling, persistent bleeding, bruising, fang marks, multiple bites
4. Check draining lymph nodes 
5. Vitals - HR, BP, RR, O2 Sats, GCS
	1. Might need to secure airway with intubation - DO NOT do tracheostomy due to coagulopathy
6. Symptoms of envenomation
7. Manage anaphylaxis, fluids, take bloods, analgesia, antihistamines, antibiotics
	1. Coagulation studies e.g. INR, aPTT, d-dimer, FBC and blood film (check for schistocytes if there is haemolysis), U&Cr, electrolytes, C, bilirubin
8. ==All patients with suspected snakebite who did not show evidence of envenoming should be observed in hospital for a minimum of 12hrs and should not be discharged in the evening or night - repeat testing should be performed 6 and 12hrs post-envenomation== 


### Signs and symptoms:

| ------------------------------------ | ----- | -------- |
| ![[Pasted image 20231025010042.png]] |Brown - use brown snake antivenom|COAGULOPATHIC|
| ![[Pasted image 20231025010049.png]] |Tiger - use tiger snake antivenom |COAGULOPATHIC, NEUROTOXIC, MYOTOXIC |
| ![[Pasted image 20231025010056.png]] |Mulga - use black snake antivenom|COAGULOPATHIC, MYOTOXIC|
| ![[Pasted image 20231025010101.png]] |Taipan - use taipan antivenom|COAGULOPATHIC, NEUROTOXIC, MYOTOXIC|
| ![[Pasted image 20231025010108.png]] |Red-bellied black snake - use tiger or black snake antivenom|COAGULOPATHIC, mild MYOTOXIC|
| ![[Pasted image 20231025010117.png]] |Death adder - use death adder antivenom|NEUROTOXIC|
|                                      |       |          |

## Antivenoms
- 6 monovallent antivenoms
	- Tiger snakke
	- Brown snake
	- Muga snake
	- Death adder
	- Taipan
	- Seasnake
- Polyvalent antivenoms (higher cost) - good for when unable to identify type of snake 

### Antivenom complications
- Antivenom anaphylaxis – adrenaline, CPR
- Neuromuscular paralysis – intubation, ventilation
- Renal injury – haemodialysis
- Coagulopathy – FFP, clotting factors
- Pre-emptive use of prednisolone
- Serum sickness  
	- 5-14 days after antivenom  
	- ‘flu-like’ illness, fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia
	- likelihood proportional to antivenom volume


# Spiders and Bugs 

1. Suspected funnel web spider bites should be treated as medical emergency - PBI, antivenom
2. Symptomatic redback bites should be fully assessed in hospital, but if asymptomatic, not necessary
3. ABC
4. Check bite site - look for swelling, sweating, piloerection, erythema, obvious fang marks
5. Check draining lymph nodes for swelling or tenderness
6. General signs of envenoming - HR, BP, SpO2, RR, GCS
7. Specific signs of envenoming:
	- Immediate significant local pain  
	- Paraesthesiae in lips ± twitching/fasciculation of the tongue  
	- Respiratory distress  
	- Increased respiratory rate, cyanosis, pulmonary oedema  
	- Increased salivation/lacrimation  
	- Marked local sweating ± piloerection  
	- Hypertension  
	- Progression severe pain in the bite site moving to the rest of the bitten limb/region  
	- Severe abdominal/chest pain  
	- Miserable, inconsolable infant  
	- Triad of progressive severe local to regional pain, marked sweating and hypertension, or a triad of local bite site pain, sweating ad piloerection
