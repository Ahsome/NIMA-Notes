***Signs and sympotms:***
- Tachycardia at rest
- Hypotension
- Narrow pulse pressure
- Raised jugular venous pressure
- Displaced apex beat (due to left ventricular dilatation)
- Right ventricular heave
- Gallop rhythm on auscultation (pathognomic for CHF)
- Murmurs associated with valvular heart disease (e.g. an ejection systolic murmur in aortic stenosis)
- Pedal and ankle oedema
- Tachypnoea
- Bibasal end-inspiratory crackles and wheeze on auscultation of the lung fields
- Hepatomegaly
- Ascites

***ECG findings** associated with heart failure include:*
- Tachycardia
- Atrial fibrillation (due to enlarged atria)
- Left-axis deviation (due to left ventricular hypertrophy)
- P wave abnormalities (e.g. P.mitrale/P.pulmonale due to atrial enlargement)
- Prolonged PR interval (due to AV block)
- Wide QRS complexes (due to ventricular dyssynchrony)

#### Chest X-ray

Typical chest X-ray findings associated with CHF include:
- **A**lveolar oedema (perihilar/bat-wing opacification)
- Kerley **B** lines (interstitial oedema)
- **C**ardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio >50%)
- **D**ilated upper lobe vessels
- **E**ffusions (e.g. pleural effusions – blunted costophrenic angles)
