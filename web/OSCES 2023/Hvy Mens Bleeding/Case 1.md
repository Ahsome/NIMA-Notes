**Current Medications:**

1. **Lisinopril (ACE Inhibitor):**
    
    - Prescribed for hypertension.
    - Monitored regularly for blood pressure control.
2. **Metformin:**
    
    - Initiated for concerns about insulin resistance and weight management.
    - Discuss compliance and side effects during the visit.
3. **Iron Supplement:**
    
    - Prescribed for mild anemia associated with heavy menstrual bleeding.
    - Discuss compliance and any gastrointestinal side effects.

**Differentials to Exclude:**

1. **Endometrial Hyperplasia or Cancer:**
   - Conduct an endometrial biopsy to rule out malignancies, given the patient's age and changes in menstrual pattern.

2. **Uterine Fibroids (Leiomyomas):**
   - Perform a pelvic ultrasound to assess for the presence of uterine fibroids contributing to heavy bleeding.

3. **Coagulopathy:**
   - Evaluate for bleeding disorders, especially with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding.

4. **Thyroid Dysfunction:**
   - Measure thyroid function to exclude hypothyroidism, which can impact menstrual regularity.

5. **Menopausal Transition:**
   - Consider the possibility of perimenopause or menopause. Assess follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.

6. **Adenomyosis:**
   - Evaluate for adenomyosis, which can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic discomfort.

**Management Plan:**

1. **Endometrial Biopsy:**
   - To rule out endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

2. **Pelvic Ultrasound:**
   - To assess for the presence of uterine fibroids and confirm the diagnosis of endometrial polyps.

3. **Coagulation Studies:**
   - If there is a suspicion of a bleeding disorder.

4. **Thyroid Function Tests:**
   - To exclude thyroid dysfunction as a contributing factor.

5. **Lifestyle Modification:**
   - Encourage lifestyle changes, including weight management, exercise, and a balanced diet.

6. **Hormonal Therapy:**
   - Consider hormonal therapies, such as progestin-containing intrauterine devices (IUDs), to manage heavy bleeding.

7. **Surgical Intervention:**
   - If polyps are confirmed and symptomatic, discuss the possibility of hysteroscopic polypectomy.

8. **Follow-Up:**
   - Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the response to treatment and adjust the management plan as needed.

    - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 18 mg/dL (Reference Range: 7 - 20 mg/dL)
    - Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (Reference Range: 0.6 - 1.3 mg/dL)
    - Electrolytes within normal range.
3. **Beta HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin):**
    
    - Negative (<5 mIU/mL)
4. **Thyroid Test:**
    
    - TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone): 2.2 mIU/L (Reference Range: 0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L)
    - Free T4: 1.1 ng/dL (Reference Range: 0.8 - 1.8 ng/dL)
5. **Prolactin Level:**
    
    - Prolactin: 12 ng/mL (Reference Range: 2 - 29 ng/mL)
6. **FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) Level:**
    
    - FSH: 7.5 mIU/mL (Reference Range: Follicular Phase: 3.5 - 12.5 mIU/mL)
7. **Estradiol:**
    
    - Estradiol: 40 pg/mL (Reference Range: Follicular Phase: 30 - 400 pg/mL)
8. **LH (Luteinizing Hormone) Level:**
    
    - LH: 8.0 mIU/mL (Reference Range: Follicular Phase: 2 - 12 mIU/mL)
9. **Coagulation Studies:**
    
    - PT (Prothrombin Time): 12 seconds (Reference Range: 10 - 14 seconds)
    - INR (International Normalized Ratio): 1.0
10. **Transvaginal Ultrasound:**
    
    - Enlarged ovaries with multiple small cysts (consistent with polycystic ovaries).
    - Presence of endometrial polyps.
- **Hysteroscopy:**

- Visual examination of the uterine cavity reveals the presence of multiple endometrial polyps. No other abnormalities or structural defects are noted during the procedure.

### Final Diagnosis:

**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) with Coexisting Endometrial Polyps**

### Management Plan:

1. **Hormonal Therapy:**
    
    - Initiate combined oral contraceptives (COCs) to regulate menstrual cycles and manage hyperandrogenic symptoms. COCs can also help reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.
2. **Lifestyle Modification:**
    
    - Emphasize lifestyle changes, including weight management, regular exercise, and a balanced diet, to improve insulin sensitivity.
3. **Hysteroscopic Polypectomy:**
    
    - Schedule hysteroscopic polypectomy to remove the identified endometrial polyps, addressing the structural cause of abnormal bleeding.
4. **Follow-Up:**
    
    - Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the response to treatment, assess menstrual regularity, and address any concerns or side effects.
5. **Patient Education:**
    
    - Educate Mrs. Johnson about PCOS, its management, and the importance of adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications.
