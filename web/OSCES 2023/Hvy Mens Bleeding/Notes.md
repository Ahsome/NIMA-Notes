# Overall approach:
0. Someone does a very good explanation here: [[#Reddit explanation]]
1. Identify issue is heavy bleeding
2. Identify if it is:
	1. Increased frequency
	2. Decreased frequency
	3. Prolonged menses
	4. Increased blood
3. Identify how much blood loss
	1. Severe (needs resus, admission, check for anemia)
		2. 1 large pad per hour for several hours
		3. Passing multiple blood clots (bigger than eggs)
	2. Else, note if large but not severe
4. Identify if patient is post-menopausal, symptoms of menopause
5. Check if the patient has anovulatory cycles (irregular/no cycles)
7. Go through the [[#^8915ef|PALMCOEIN]] mnemonic for causes of uterine bleeding
	1. Ask for signs of menopause, could be caused by decreased progesterone
	2. Post-coital bleed: Could be due to sex causing vaginal laceration
8. Consider non-uterine causes:
	1. GI, vaginal/cervical lesion, STI, bleeding disorders
9. Before testing:
	1. Clarify history of migraine/aura 
	2. Clarify history of smoking
	3. Clarify history of stroke
	4. Clarify history of thromboembolism
10. Examniation:
	1. Bimanual: Identify fibroids, polyps
	2. Also rule out vaginal laceration, potentially due to sex
11. Testing:
	1. History and Exam is critical to find diagnosis
	2. Standard testing:
		1. B-hCG: Rule out pregnancy
		2. CBC: Rule out anemia from bleeding. If present, consider iron study
	3. Others:
		1. TSH
		2. Prolactin (can cause anovulation, from a prolactinoma or from drugs)
		3. FSH
			1. Goes **up** in premature ovarian failure, can cause anovulation
		4. Estradiol
			1. Goes **down** in premature ovarian failure, can cause anovulation
		5. LH
			1. Ratio of FSH/LH indicative of PCOS
		6. Coags
	4. Imaging:
		1. **Pelvic ultrasound**: First-line imaigng choice for AUB in most patients
		2. **Indicated** if any abnormalitires on bimanual examination OR symptoms persist after treatment OR pelvic exam limited by body habitus
		3. **Can** use hysteroscopy: Finds polyps and also biopsy if suspicious
			1. **Always** do if post-menopausal
			2. If pre-menopausal, do if there are risk factors for endometrial cancer:
				1. **Anovulatory cycles**. Increased exposure of uterus to oestrogen, drives cancer
				2. **Obesity**. Increased exposure of uterus to oestrogen, drives cancer
				3. **Nulliparity**. Increased exposure of uterus to oestrogen, drives cancer
				4. **Older age** (> 35). More likely to get a malignancy
				5. Tamoxifen Therapy
				6. Abnormal USS lining thickness
12. Treatment:
	1. If specifically **heavy bleeding**:
		1. Treat underlying cause (polyps, adenomyosis, fibroids)
		2. Often high dose progesterone: Stabilises endometrium, makes less friable
			1. Either from Levonorgestrel IUD
			2. Or, high dose progesterone via megestrol acetate (Megace)
		3. Maybe COCP, make bleeding regular and lighter, reduce dysmenorrhea
			1. Risk factors:
			1. Migraines w/ aura,
			2. smoking > 35
			3. family history/previous history of breast cancer
			4. DVT history/Stroke
		4. Potentially **Tranexamic acid**: Antifribrinolytic, causes more clotting. 
			1. **Used in patients who cannot take COCs**. Less bleeding because of more clots, but **cannot be used** in thromboembolism or increased risk
			2. Only in menses
		5. NSAIDs. Causes endometrial vasoconstriction, decrease volume of menstrual blood loss
		6. **IF CHRONIC**, and no fix, can use permanent solutions:
			1. Endometrial ablation
			2. Uterine artery embolisation
			3. Hysterectomy

# Notes

## Uterine Bleeding
Different subtypes:
1. Frequent uterine bleeding: more often than every 24 days
2. Infrequent: Less than every 28 days
3. Prolonged: More than 8 days
4. Heavy menstrual bleeding: more than 80ml per cycle (hard to measure

**Causes** can be remembered by the mnemonic **PALMCOEIN** ^8915ef
1. P: Polyps. Can be found via Hysteroscopy
2. A: Adenomyosis (fibroids). Can be identified via Pelvic USS
3. L: Leiomyoma (fibroids) Can be identified via Pelvic USS
4. M: Malignancy/Endometrial Hyperplasia
5. C: Coagulopathy
6. O: Ovulatory dysfunction
7. E: Endometrial/Endocrinopathy causes (if bleeding but not other causes, it is a diagnosis of exclusion)
	1. Check for TSH and Prolactin to rule out as cause
8. I: Iatrogenic (IUD, drugs)
9. N: NOS

**Ovulatory dysfunction:**
**Halmark signs:**
- Irregular bleeding when not ovulating
- Either no bleeding for one or more months, or spotting/heavy bleeding
- **Most common**:
	- At menarche (underdeveloped Hypo-Pit-Ovary axis) and menopause (loss of ovulation).
	- Also PCOS, Obesity, Thyroid

1. Menstrual cycle without ovulation
2. After ovulation, corpus luteum is formed, produces progesterones
3. If no ovulation, no corpus luteum, no progesterones, then unapposed estrogen to drive growth of endometrium and cause irregular bleeding

### *Low-Yield*
Older terms:
1. Menorrhagia: heavy or prolonged bleeding
2. Metrorrhagia: Bleeding between normal menses
3. Menometorrhagia: Heavy bleeding between normal menses
4. Oligomenorrhea: Irreguar cycles > 35 days apart

---

## Dysmenorrhea:
Red flags for dysmenorrhea:
1. **Onset of age > 25**
2. **Non-midline pain**
3. Abnormal uterine bleeding
4. Painful urination or intercourse
5. Symptom progression over time

## Reddit explanation
Ok so a few things to go through here. First and foremost, tranexamic acid (TXA) is treating a symptom, which is uterine bleeding. It does not treat the underlying cause of the bleeding unless the cause is a coagulopathy. It would be like giving someone with intense right lower quadrant pain morphine and believing that you were treating the person. If they have appendicitis, the morphine will decrease their pain, but it‚Äôs not treating the underlying cause of the pain.

There are many causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and these are typically presented using the PALM COEIN mnemonic. These stand for:

- Polyps
- Adenomyosis
- Leiomyomata (fibroids)
- Malignancy and Hyperplasia
    
- Coagulopathy
    
- Ovulatory dysfunction
    
- Endocrinopathy
    
- Iatrogenic (e.g. patient on lovenox, develops AKI, lovenox levels increase, suddenly they have AUB)
    
- Not otherwise specified ie ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    

Occasionally you‚Äôll see vaginal lacerations as well from sex or toys.

When you work up a patient for AUB, THE guiding principle is that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt figure out the cause of the AUB, you will never be able to treat it.‚Äù

Your approach should be based on the patient and a compromise between what is most likely to be the cause of their bleeding and what is most likely to kill the patient if they have it (even if it is overall a less likely cause). You must always consider cancer and rule it out. Typically someone with anovulatory bleeding will be obese, which is also a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer. In someone obese with persistent AUB, even if they are young, you should do an endometrial biopsy (EMB) to assess the uterine lining. In an older patient, certainly cancer is front and center on your radar. The average age of onset of endometrial cancer is 62 in the US. In these patients you can either do an EMB or a transvaginal ultrasound to assess the thickness of their endometrial lining. You can substitute a dilatation and curettage (D&C) for an EMB if needed. You should also do a Pap smear to rule out cervical cancer, which can also present with vaginal bleeding (classically postcoital). You would consider this especially in a patient who smokes. Of course you should do a physical exam to rule out a vaginal laceration or a cervical polyp.

If you have ruled out cancer, you can then assess for other causes. You can get coags and take a good history to assess for a coagulopathy and you should also get a TSH and prolactin to assess for an endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism or a prolactinoma). You would either use a transvaginal ultrasound or saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) to assess for fibroids, adenomyosis, and polyps (would more likely appear on the SIS). You may get polyploid tissue on an EMB or a D&C as well. You can also do a hysteroscopy, where you put a camera into the uterus and visualize the interior of the cavity.

Anovulatory bleeding is often diagnosed by history. Typically the patient will have months where they have no period and then they will bleed continually for several weeks. In a normal ovulatory cycle, the patient ovulates and subsequently sheds their endometrium every month. When ovulation doesn‚Äôt occur, the lining continues to build up until it outgrows its blood supply, at which point it sloughs off for an extended period of time. The treatment for anovulatory bleeding is typically to give the patient progesterone for about 10 days. When they stop it at that point, it signals the body to ovulate and they then have a withdrawal bleed.

I know this is a long response, but I wanted to give you some background and explain how we approach a very common problem with many different causes: abnormal uterine bleeding.

If you have diagnosed someone with anovulatory bleeding, the progesterone is what will actually treat this by trying to return them to regular ovulatory cycles. TXA is an antifibrinolytic agent, which means it prevents clot breakdown. The uterus has a rich blood supply with spiral arteries extending into the endometrium. These bleed when the endometrium sheds. TXA presumably allows these bleeding points to clot more effectively by preventing clot breakdown. Thus TXA treats the symptom of bleeding, and symptomatic treatment may be very necessary. Some people with persistent, long-standing anovulatory bleeding come into the ED with slowly worsening iron-deficiency anemia (I‚Äôve seen a hemoglobin as low as 1.9), so lessening the intensity of the symptom while treating the cause of the symptom is warranted. Just like in my example (now very far) up above, you do an appendectomy, but you still give morphine for pain.

So that is a very in-depth and long-winded way of saying that your book is telling you to give progesterone to treat the cause of anovulatory bleeding along with TXA to treat the severity of the bleeding symptomatically. The progesterone, by returning the person to an ovulatory cycle, is also protective against their developing endometrial cancer, since the most common type of this cancer arises from a precursor lesion that is endometrial hyperplasia. Thus, the progesterone also prevents the development of another potential cause of abnormal uterine bleeding in addition to treating anovulatory bleeding.

I know there are many more experienced Ob-Gyns than me on here who can correct any mistakes I made if they can make it through these walls of text! üòÖ
