*"Do you notice any shortness of breath?"*
>*"Do you notice any wheezing? Any cough?"*
>*"Any history of allergies? Family history of allergies?"*
>*"Is this consistent, or does it come in attacks/episodes?"*
>*"Does it come when you're stressed, such as exercise?"*
>*"Do you take aspirin?"*

Management:
1. Reliever VS preventer therapy 
2. How to use a spacer
3. Asthma action plan

**Task 1: History Taking:**

1. Begin by introducing yourself and establishing rapport with the parent.
2. Ask open-ended questions to gather information about Emily's symptoms, including the onset, duration, and any triggering factors.
3. Explore any relevant medical history, including allergies, respiratory conditions, or recent illnesses.
4. Inquire about the child's activity level, any recent changes in the environment, and whether there have been any previous episodes of shortness of breath.

**Task 2: Respiratory Assessment:**

1. Briefly assess Emily's general appearance, respiratory rate, and signs of distress.
2. Perform a focused respiratory examination, including auscultation of breath sounds and observation of any use of accessory muscles.
3. Consider appropriate differential diagnoses based on the information gathered.

**Task 3: Explanation of Reliever Inhaler and Spacer:**

1. Explain to the parent that Emily may benefit from using a reliever inhaler with a spacer.
2. Demonstrate the correct technique for using the inhaler and spacer, emphasizing the importance of proper coordination between inhalation and activation of the inhaler.
3. Provide clear instructions on the frequency of use and under what circumstances the reliever should be administered.
4. Address any concerns the parent may have and encourage questions.
