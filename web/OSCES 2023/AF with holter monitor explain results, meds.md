**Station Title: Atrial Fibrillation Management**
**Scenario:** You are a healthcare professional (you can choose your role, e.g., doctor, nurse, pharmacist) in a primary care setting. The patient, Mr. Smith, a 65-year-old male, has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation during a recent hospital visit. He is now in your office seeking further information and clarification regarding his condition and the prescribed medications.

**Task 1: Interpretation of Atrial Fibrillation:**

1. Interpret the ECG findings and be prepared to explain to the patient what atrial fibrillation is.
2. Explain the management

**Task 2: Medication Explanation:**

1. Explain to Mr. Smith the prescribed medications for managing atrial fibrillation. The medications include:
    
    - **CHADS2VASC – widely used score to determine whether anticoagulation should be initiated. Score > 2 requires anticoagulation.**
-   HASBLED – bleeding risk in these pts should be considered in conjunction with  thromboembolic stroke and relative risk weighed up.
-   ==Warfarin – target INR 2.0 to 3.0 (2.5 ideal), 2.5 to 3.5 in mechanical valves==
-   NOAC/DOAC – rivaroxaban (Xarelto) most common

   Rate control – slowing of the heart rate by targeting the AV node. Better long-term mortality benefits of rate control over rhythm.
	- **Beta blocker (1st line)** – atenolol, metoprolol  
	- **Non-dihydropyridine CCB (2nd line)** – verapamil, diltiazem (not great in CCF) 
	- **Digoxin (last line)** – be careful in CKD.
	
-   Rhythm control – ==percutaneous catheter ablation, anti-arrhythmic drugs==. In many patients, the pro-arrhythmic nature of anti-arrhythmics is not tolerated, especially in older patients. However, rhythm control is preferred in certain patients:
	- Symptomatic CCF patients 
	- Younger patients (<65YO)
	- Flecainide (Na)(1C)
	- Quinidine (Na)(1A)
	- Sotalol(b+K)  
	- Amiodarone (K)

Valvular AF – AF with a mitral valve lesion, especially stenosis. These MUST be anticoagulated with warfarin. The literature shows that DOACs can increase mortality rate.
- Mechanical valve – INR target should be 2.5 to 3.5.


**Communication Skills:**

1. Use clear and jargon-free language to ensure Mr. Smith understands the information.
2. Assess and address any concerns or questions Mr. Smith may have about his condition or medications.
3. Ensure that Mr. Smith is comfortable with the treatment plan and understands the importance of adherence.

**Time:** 15 minutes
