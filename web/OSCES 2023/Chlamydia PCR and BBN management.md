**Station Title: Communicating a Positive Chlamydia Diagnosis**

**Scenario:** You are a healthcare professional (you can choose your role, e.g., doctor, nurse, sexual health counselor) in a sexual health clinic. A 25-year-old woman, Sarah, has come in reporting symptoms of greenish odourous discharge. Your task is to conduct an empathetic and informative session to take a history deliver the diagnosis, discuss implications, and recommend appropriate management.


#### Presenting Complaint (bleeding)
**S**ite / main symptom – main presenting complaint is discharge from the vagina.  
**O**nset - It started 1 week ago  
**C**haracter - You’re having to use pads to stop the discharge, it’s not soaking through but it’s definitely there all the time. It is yellow. It has no smell. There is no blood.  
**R**adiation - No urinary symptoms and the discharge is definitely from the vagina and not the urethra. No anal symptoms, no throat symptoms.  
**A**ssociated symptoms - you have pain during sex since the discharge started but none at rest. You have never had pain during sex before this discharge started.  
**A**ssociated symptoms - itch is present, no rashes, no ulcers, no dysuria  
**T**iming - it’s only been a week so you haven't noticed if it’s worse in different parts of your cycle but you wouldn’t usually have discharge like this at this point in your cycle.  
**E**xacerbating factors - none  
**S**everity - You have stopped going out because you are embarrassed that the discharge might start to smell.

*Gynae history*
**Last menstrual period** - 18 months ago, you’ve not had periods since starting the COCP.  
**Age of menarche** - 16  
**Relevant sexual history/current status** - you broke up with your ex-boyfriend 5 weeks ago as you had unresolvable differences around having children. You were together for 3 years. You have had unprotected sex with 1 casual male partner since the breakup. You do not know if your recent casual partner has had symptoms because you were too embarrassed to ask him.  
**Type of sex** - vaginal sex only, no oral sex, all sex had been consensual.  
**STI status** - you’ve never been tested  
**Contraception** - you are on the COCP which you like very much because it stopped your periods. You are very good at taking the COCP despite your busy lifestyle - you have an app that reminds you. You do not like condoms and you think it is unlikely you will catch anything because “I only sleep with people I know”.  
**Smear status** - the last was 6 months ago it was normal  
**BBV (blood bourne virus) screen** - never paid for sex, never had tattoos/piercings overseas, never used IV drugs, never has sex abroad, you have had your Hepatitis A, B, and HPV jabs.
