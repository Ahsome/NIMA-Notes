# Vaginal discharge
## Chlamydia Trachomatis
Causes **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease** alongside N. Gonorrhea
- Infection of the female "upper genital tract" (uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries)
- Normal vaginal flora has many pathogenic bacteria
- Upper genital tract often sterile, protected by cervical canal, so disruption can cause ascending infection
- **Clinical tenderness**
	- Requires pelvic/lower abdo tenderness, cervical motion tenderness an uterine/adnexal tenderness
	- Pelvic imaging (e.g. transvaginal USS) **not required** for diagnosis unless severe (e.g. high fever, nausea, vomiting, severe pain OR woman hospiltalised). Used to exclude tubo-ovarian abscess
- Symptoms:
	- **Cervical motion tenderness**
	- Lower abdo, pelbic, uterine or adnexal tenderness
	- Purulant cervical discharge
	- Spotting or bleeding
	- Fevers, chills
	- Perihepatitis
		- Inflammation of liver capsule caused by spread of infection
		- Right upper quadrant pain, often pleuritic
		- Treat same as PID
- Risk factors:
	- Sexual activity
	- Multiple partners
	- Prior STI or PID
	- Lack of barrier protection
	- **VERY** **Rare** during pregnancy (mucous plug)
- Treatment:
	- Milder cases can be **outpatient**
	- Hospitalisation criteria:
		- High fever
		- Nausea and Vomiting
		- Severe pain
		- tubo-ovarian abscess
		- Pregnancy
	- Normally **Cephalosporin + DOxy**
		- Not just Chlamydia, but also other bacteria from vagina that came up
		- Covers gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobes
	- **Outpatient:** ceftriaxone IM + doxy PO
	- **Inpatient** Cefotixin IV + doxy PO ("foxy doxy")
- Long-term:
	- Can leave scarring and adhesions of uterus or fallopian tubes
	- Leads to **Infertility** and **Ectopic Pregnancy**

## Bacterial vaginosis
- Bacterial vaginosis, thin and off-white with unpleasant “fishy smell”.
- Due to changes in biome of vagina, loss of lactobacilli and increase in Garderella vaginalis
- Most often corelated with sexual activity (very rare to get with no sex). Associated with douching and smoking. 
- Test:
	- high pH (lack of bacilli)
	- clue cells on histo saline wet mount of discharge
	- Whiff test (smell wet mount slide after applying potassium hyroxide KOH, makes bad smell). 
- Treatment:
	- **Metronidazole gel**. 
	- Does **NOT** need to treat partner as not STI

## Trichomonas Vaginalis
- Treatment:
	- Metronidazole, 7 day course
	- TREAT PARTNERS as STI

## Vuvlovaginal Candidiasis
- Often called yeast infection
- Overgrowth of Candida species, normally *Candida Albicans* (90%)
- Rarely oters *C. Glabrata* and *C. parapsilosis*
- Symptoms
	- **Pruritis**
	- Burning (dysuria)
	- **Vaginal discharge**: Classically white, thick, clumpy (curd-like or cottage cheese)
	- **Minimal odor**
- Risk factors:
	- Antibiotic use (kills normal bacteria flora)
	- Diabetes (immunosupressive, consider A1c testing)
	- Immunosuppresion
- Treatment:
	- **Uncomplicated**: SIngle dose of oral gluconazole
		- Uncomplicated is <=3 episodes per year, mild-to-moderate symptoms, immunocompetent and nonpregnant
	- Sometimes long-terms suppressive therapy
	- If **not** treated, consider rare case of *Candida Glabrata*. Identified by culture, treatment is **intravaginal boric acid**
