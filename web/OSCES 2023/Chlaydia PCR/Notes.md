# Vaginal discharge
## Chlamydia Trachomatis
Causes **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease**
- Infection of the female "upper genital tract" (uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries)
- Normal vaginal flora has many pathogenic bacteria
- Upper genital tract often sterile, protected by cervical cana, so disruption can cause ascending infection

## Bacterial vaginosis
- Bacterial vaginosis, thin and off-white with unpleasant “fishy smell”.
- Due to changes in biome of vagina, loss of lactobacilli and increase in Garderella vaginalis
- Most often corelated with sexual activity (very rare to get with no sex). Associated with douching and smoking. 
- Test:
	- high pH (lack of bacilli)
	- clue cells on histo saline wet mount of discharge
	- Whiff test (smell wet mount slide after applying potassium hyroxide KOH, makes bad smell). 
- Treatment:
	- **Metronidazole gel**. 
	- Does **NOT** need to treat partner as not STI

## Trichomonas Vaginalis
- Treatment:
	- Metronidazole, 7 day course
	- TREAT PARTNERS as STI

## Vuvlovaginal Candidiasis
- Often called yeast infection
- Overgrowth of Candida species, normally *Candida Albicans* (90%)
- Rarely oters *C. Glabrata* and *C. parapsilosis*
- Symptoms
	- **Pruritis**
	- Burning (dysuria)
	- **Vaginal discharge**: Classically white, thick, clumpy (curd-like or cottage cheese)
	- **Minimal odor**
- Risk factors:
	- Antibiotic use (kills normal bacteria flora)
	- Diabetes (immunosupressive, consider A1c testing)
	- Immunosuppresion
- Treatment:
	- **Uncomplicated**: SIngle dose of oral gluconazole
		- Uncomplicated is <=3 episodes per year, mild-to-moderate symptoms, immunocompetent and nonpregnant
	- Sometimes long-terms suppressive therapy
	- If **not** treated, consider rare case of *Candida Glabrata*. Identified by culture, treatment is **intravaginal boric acid**
