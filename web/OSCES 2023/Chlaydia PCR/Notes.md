# Approach:
The steps involved will be:
1. Vaginal Discharge Hx
2. Looking at PCR result, positive for Chlamydia
3. BBN for Chlamydia, explain management

### Vaginal Discharge Hx.
Questions to ask:
1. Any present discharge?
2. Colour and consistency of discharge?
3. Itchiness in the area?
4. Abnormal bleeding?
	1. Between periods?
	2. After sex?
5. Recent sexual Hx
	1. Any recent sex?
	2. Previous history, number of partners in last 6 months?
	3. Pain on intercourse?
	4. If so, deep pain or superficial pain?
	5. Types of sexual activity?
6. STI testing?
7. Pain on urination?
8. Fever, tachycardia?
9. Abdominal pain?
10. Anal changes? **Key as it changes management**
	1. Anal pain
	2. Anal discharge
	3. Changes in bowel habit
	4. Tenesmus

### Chlamydia Management
1. Explain what it is, STI, bacteria, likely from another source
2. Explain 85-90% have no symptoms, but there are key complications
	1. PID
	2. Affects pregnancies
	3. Can cause infertility
3. Explain how test works
	1. Nucleic acid amplification test amplifies Chlamydia genetic material
4. Ongoing management
	1. **Uncomplicated:** 100mg Doxy BD 7/7, or Azithrymycin 1g PO stat
	2. **Pregnant:** Azitrhomyic 1g PO
	3. **Anorectal infection:** 100mg Doxy BD 7/7 if asymptomatic, 21 if asymptomatic
	4. No sexual contact for **7 days** after treatment has commenced, **OR** until symptoms resolve
	5. No sex with partners from last 6 months as potentially infective
	6. Contact tracing, state either patient does, you can anonymously, or work with contract tracing team
	7. Consider testing other STI
	8. Fact sheet
	9. **Notify the state, tell you will do this**
	10. Follow up: Check up on adherence to treatment **AND** confirm contract tracing. There is **no** need for re-testing to see if cured
	11. Safety net

# Vaginal discharge
## Chlamydia Trachomatis
Causes **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease** alongside N. Gonorrhea
- Infection of the female "upper genital tract" (uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries)
- Normal vaginal flora has many pathogenic bacteria
- Upper genital tract often sterile, protected by cervical canal, so disruption can cause ascending infection
- **Clinical tenderness**
	- Requires pelvic/lower abdo tenderness, cervical motion tenderness an uterine/adnexal tenderness
	- Pelvic imaging (e.g. transvaginal USS) **not required** for diagnosis unless severe (e.g. high fever, nausea, vomiting, severe pain OR woman hospiltalised). Used to exclude tubo-ovarian abscess
- Symptoms:
	- **Cervical motion tenderness**
	- Lower abdo, pelbic, uterine or adnexal tenderness
	- Purulant cervical discharge
	- Spotting or bleeding
	- Fevers, chills
	- Perihepatitis
		- Inflammation of liver capsule caused by spread of infection
		- Right upper quadrant pain, often pleuritic
		- Treat same as PID
- Risk factors:
	- Sexual activity
	- Multiple partners
	- Prior STI or PID
	- Lack of barrier protection
	- **VERY** **Rare** during pregnancy (mucous plug)
- Treatment:
	- Milder cases can be **outpatient**
	- Hospitalisation criteria:
		- High fever
		- Nausea and Vomiting
		- Severe pain
		- tubo-ovarian abscess
		- Pregnancy
	- Normally **Cephalosporin + DOxy**
		- Not just Chlamydia, but also other bacteria from vagina that came up
		- Covers gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobes
	- **Outpatient:** ceftriaxone IM + doxy PO
	- **Inpatient** Cefotixin IV + doxy PO ("foxy doxy")
- Long-term:
	- Can leave scarring and adhesions of uterus or fallopian tubes
	- Leads to **Infertility** and **Ectopic Pregnancy**

## Bacterial vaginosis
- Bacterial vaginosis, thin and off-white with unpleasant “fishy smell”.
- Due to changes in biome of vagina, loss of lactobacilli and increase in Garderella vaginalis
- Most often corelated with sexual activity (very rare to get with no sex). Associated with douching and smoking. 
- Test:
	- high pH (lack of bacilli)
	- clue cells on histo saline wet mount of discharge
	- Whiff test (smell wet mount slide after applying potassium hyroxide KOH, makes bad smell). 
- Treatment:
	- **Metronidazole gel**. 
	- Does **NOT** need to treat partner as not STI

## Trichomonas Vaginalis
- Treatment:
	- Metronidazole, 7 day course
	- TREAT PARTNERS as STI

## Vuvlovaginal Candidiasis
- Often called yeast infection
- Overgrowth of Candida species, normally *Candida Albicans* (90%)
- Rarely oters *C. Glabrata* and *C. parapsilosis*
- Symptoms
	- **Pruritis**
	- Burning (dysuria)
	- **Vaginal discharge**: Classically white, thick, clumpy (curd-like or cottage cheese)
	- **Minimal odor**
- Risk factors:
	- Antibiotic use (kills normal bacteria flora)
	- Diabetes (immunosupressive, consider A1c testing)
	- Immunosuppresion
- Treatment:
	- **Uncomplicated**: SIngle dose of oral gluconazole
		- Uncomplicated is <=3 episodes per year, mild-to-moderate symptoms, immunocompetent and nonpregnant
	- Sometimes long-terms suppressive therapy
	- If **not** treated, consider rare case of *Candida Glabrata*. Identified by culture, treatment is **intravaginal boric acid**
