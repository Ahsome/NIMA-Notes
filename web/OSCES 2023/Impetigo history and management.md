## Key points
- Impetigo is a common **superficial skin infection** most commonly caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_.
- The most common form of impetigo is the **non-bullous form**. Infection occurs via **breaks in the skin barrier** which allow entry of bacteria, causing the formation of small crops of vesicles which eventually rupture to form the characteristic golden-honey-crusted lesions.
- In bullous impetigo, bacteria invade the intact skin barrier and form **bullae** which rupture easily.
- Diagnosis is usually made based on **clinical examination** findings.
- Non-bullous impetigo usually heals quickly and effectively with **topical treatment** such as hydrogen peroxide or fusidic acid.
- **Oral antibiotics** should be offered to all patients with bullous impetigo.
- For both forms, **strict hygiene measures** are required to prevent the spread to other people.
- Complications are rare but will require **urgent referral** to secondary care should they occur.

## Differential diagnoses to consider in the context of impetigo include:
- **Herpes simplex virus**: this can present similarly with small crops of vesicles, which erode and are typically painful in nature. These can present around the mouth (type 1) or the genitalia following sexual contact (type 2).
- [**Chickenpox**](https://geekymedics.com/chickenpox/): caused by the varicella-zoster virus; this most commonly presents in children with general malaise and fever accompanied by crops of vesicles which progress to become pustular before crusting over.
- **Cellulitis**: often presents with a demarcated area of erythema, swelling and warmth. There are usually no vesicles or pustules present.
- **Bullous pemphigoid**: this most commonly presents in the elderly with tense, large blisters on the limbs or trunk.
- [**Steven-Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis**](https://geekymedics.com/toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-stevens-johnson-syndrome-ten-sjs/): patients may have a flu-like prodrome before a painful rash forms, this typically spreads within hours; the affected skin will then blister before desquamation occurs.

## MANAGEMENT:
- Hygiene advice such as regular hand washing, avoiding touching the affected area and not sharing towels with other people.
- Advice not to attend school or work until the lesions are dry and crusted over, or have had 48 hours of oral antibiotics.
- Bullous - flucloxacillin
- Non-bullous: 
	  - If localised, offer a 5-day course of **hydrogen peroxide 1%** cream. If more widespread, a **topical antibiotic** such as can be used such as fusidic acid 2% or mupirocin 2%.
	- Oral antibiotics such as flucloxacillin can be used if **systemically unwell** or at high risk of complications.
