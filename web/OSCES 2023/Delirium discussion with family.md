Mr T is a 72 year old man post-hip replacement in the hospital. He has been recovering for 3 days but recently has started acting weird, becoming confused and wandering the corridors in the evenings. He is saying weird things such as "the onion man is watching me". Do a history and examination on Mr T (6mins) and explain the diagnosis to his concerned wife who comes to visit (2mins).
