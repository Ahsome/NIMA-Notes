- Lady with 8 weeks gestation with spotting 
- Interpret investigations
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Threated miscarriage
	- If progressed, can be Inevitable, Incomplete or Missed
	- ![[Pasted image 20231118031135.png]]
- Rarely:
	- Subchorionic hematoma, or GTD
	- Rule out PALM-COEIN
- **SUPER RARE** 
	- **Pelvic** Inflammatory Disease, causing cervical spotting or bleeding
	- VERY RARE as pregnancy blocks pathogens from going up
- When considering ectopic pregnancy or otherwise, check B-hCG
	- ![[Pasted image 20231118030718.png]]
	- TVS will show a complex adnexal mass/free fluid in the adnexal area, with a "ring of fire sign" on Doppler USS.
	- **Note:** Also can be seen in corpus luteal cyst, however this does **NOT** have elevated B-hCG

Determining pregnancy location: Ectopic pregnancy must always be ruled out in early pregnancy. Unless a patient has risk factors for a heterotopic pregnancy (eg, use of assisted reproductive technologies), visualization of a yolk sac and/or embryo/fetus establishes the pregnancy location; if these structures are seen within the uterus, ectopic pregnancy is effectively ruled out. If ultrasound cannot definitively identify the location of the pregnancy, serial hCG levels and ultrasounds should be obtained every 48 to 72 hours until the location is confirmed or hCG levels fall to non-pregnant levels.[[12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470230/#) (A full discussion regarding the evaluation of a potential ectopic pregnancy is discussed elsewhere.)

Assessing fetal viability: The presence of FCA confirms viability (Fetal Cardiac Activity). If the cervical os remains closed, the pregnancy may (or may not) progress to a live birth, even in the setting of vaginal bleeding, though heavier bleeding increases the risk of pregnancy loss. Pregnancy loss is inevitable if the internal cervical os is open on exam and/or ultrasound. Once a fetal pole with FCA is visible on ultrasound, an hCG level typically is not needed, and viability can be followed with serial ultrasounds.[[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470230/#) Prior to the visualization of FCA, specific ultrasound criteria can be used to diagnose early pregnancy failure.[[14]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470230/#) (These criteria are discussed in detail elsewhere.)[[15]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470230/#)
